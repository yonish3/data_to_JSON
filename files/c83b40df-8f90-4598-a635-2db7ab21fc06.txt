Get your Z-Trek           Lightweight Sport Sandal - Men now and Live Life Feet First!   a How do I get the right size for my               Z-Trek?  Use the templates that are             linked on this page (next to where you select the size, and in the             product description).            NOTE: Please measure your foot and/or use the templates.             Sandal size is very often different than shoe size.           a What if the Z-Trek is too long for               me?  There are 54 different foot             shapes. And no product will fit everyone perfectly.            If youג€™re not sure you have the right size, drop us an email with             some photos (top, side, back) and weג€™ll give you our opinion.            If you have the right size but the Z-Trek shape doesnג€™t quite match             your footג€¦ CUT IT! Thatג€™s right, you can trim the Z-Trek with a good             pair of kitchen scissors. To finish the edge cleanly, try some             sandpaper. Donג€™t cut off too much, too soon, though. Take off just a             bit, and then see how you did. Remember, you canג€™t UN-cut.            If youג€™re a man with a very narrow foot, you may be better in the             ג€womenג€™sג€ style. Conversely, women with very wide feet, or over a             size 10, should check the sizing for he ג€menג€™sג€ products.           a What can I do in the Z-Trek?  Pretty             much anything you want. Take a walk on the beach, a hike in the             woods, hang out with friend, stroll around the campsite, approach a             climb, paddle a canoe, run a marathonג€¦            Iג€™m not sure that Z-Trek, or any sandal for that matter, is right             for lateral motion sports, like tennis or basketball.            So, use your common sense and HAVE FUN!           a Can I adjust the Z-Trek lacing               across the toes?  You sure can. Just slide the             webbing through the slots on the outside of the sole to get the             tension you like.            Note: A lot of our customers report that they like the toe strap             looser than they thought they would. Experiment and see what you             like best.           a Whatג€™s the difference between Menג€™s               and Womenג€™s Z-Trek?  The womenג€™s Z-Trek is a bit             narrower, and the webbing is 4mm thinner.            So if you have a narrow foot, whether youג€™re a man or woman, you             may want to check the ג€womenג€™sג€ sizing templates and see             how those work for you. Similarly, if you have a wider foot,             regardless of your gender, check out the ג€menג€™sג€ templates.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

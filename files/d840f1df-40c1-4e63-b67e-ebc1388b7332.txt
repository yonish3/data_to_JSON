Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BLUEBIRD 

Short description:
This lowcut made of 100% linen from certified organic sources impresses not only
with its cool blue color, but also thanks to its wonderfully cooling and
moisture-absorbing properties, which make the Bluebird a perfect companion,
particularly in the summer.
Covered with cotton, the integrated hemp-flax fleece insole regulates the
climate in this minimal shoe. Its incredibly thin and flexible outsole provides
your foot with unrestricted freedom of movement.
If you want to add a splash more color, you can switch the cool blue laces made
of cotton from certified organic sources for other cotton or elastic ones,
available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

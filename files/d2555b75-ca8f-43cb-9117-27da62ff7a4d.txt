Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: JAY 

Short description:
The meadow at the edge of the forest is full of life, humming, buzzing, swishing
and rustling. A group of young jays jump through the high grass. They play out a
random choreography; quick as lightning they switch places, outdoing each other
with tumbling aerial manoeuvres. Today their sky-blue wings gleam even more than
usual.
A mix of cooling linen and robust hemp – both from certified organic sources –
makes this lowcut a perfect summer companion for little wildlings.
The moisture-regulating insole made of hemp-flax fleece combines with the
GOTS-certified cotton cover to create a wonderful foot climate.
A flexible and only 2.5 mm thin outsole allows limitless freedom for you and
your feet.
If you prefer more color, you can switch the light-blue elastic laces for other
elastic or cotton ones, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

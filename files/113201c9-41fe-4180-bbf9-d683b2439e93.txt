Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ROSE CHAFER 

Short description:
The last wind cost the old oak a couple of branches. Fresh resin pools around the
wounds, shining softly in the warm sun. The rose chafer hurries over to quench
its thirst with the sweet sap. Its shell and the resin shimmer in harmony,
seeming not to want to reveal their true color.
The Rose Chafer has a special outer layer: Its upper consists of blue-green dry
oilskin, a breathable cotton fabric from certified organic sources, which is
treated with wax.
The integrated hemp-flax fleece insole covered with GOTS-certified cotton
ensures a comfortable foot climate.
Its thin, flexible sole matches every move, supporting little adventurers in all
their activities.
The emerald elastic laces can be switched for other elastic or cotton laces,
available separately.
Please note:
After heavy use you can retreat the shoes with oilskin wax.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: NEBULA 

Short description:
The stars shine bright in the crystal-clear night sky. High up in the heavens, a
nebula glistens with innumerable colors, shapes and celestial bodies. The little
wildling gazes with longing at the sky, dreaming of all the adventures to be
found up there.
This low-cut shoe is an airy hybrid that combines an anatomically shaped knitted
body with the classic Wildling design.
The unique fit of this ultimate minimal shoe is achieved using only three
sections, put together using only a few simple stitches.
This allows the Nebula to embrace the foot like a second skin. With its minimal
weight of only 50-100g, you’ll hardly notice that it's there.
Thanks to a special knitting technique, only the inside - made of IVN
Best-certified and climate-regulating Merino wool - comes into contact with your
feet. The outside consists of abrasion-resistant polyester. The material used
provides excellent breathability, and, together with the gap in the Wildling
sole, allows air to circulate around the foot. So Nebulas are perfect for indoor
and outdoor sports, able to keep up with little adventurers move for move.
For additional comfort, Nebula has a removable insole that facilitates airing
and drying, not to mention microfibre padding at the heel.
If your little wildling has a taste for more color, you can swap the flat Tencel
laces for other cotton or elastic laces, available separately.

Please note:
This low cut is water permeable. When airing and drying, we recommend removing
the insole.

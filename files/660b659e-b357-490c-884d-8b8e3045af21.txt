(click here)    Brujita means ''Little Witch'' in Spanish. Rooted     refers to the traditional leather laces and tying method used to secure the     sandal.    This undeniably good-looking, traditionally styled sandal is     comfortable enough to wear all day yet elegant enough to look good     out on the town = comfortable fashion. No small feat to achieve. Combine     both qualities and you have the Rooted Brujita sandal.       Rooted Brujitas are like       all other LUNA Roots and Rooted sandals, i.e., they take       a little skill to master wearing them; however, it is a surprisingly       easy skill to master and it gives you so much more control over the       comfort of the sandal on ''your'' foot. If you follow the ''How To Tie LUNA Roots Sandals'', you       will soon master it for yourself.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: HUMMINGBIRD 

Short description:
Delicate yet so full of life, fragile yet so wild. The days of summer adventures
are getting shorter, filled with excitement the tiny Hummingbird quickly flies
back into the warm nest and snuggles up to its siblings and parents. Soon the
little bird in its shimmering plumage will set off with its family on the
journey to their winter quarters. What adventures will await him there?
The Hummingbird keeps little feet warm with virgin wool from the rough wool of
Pomeranian sheep. An integrated membrane also protects them from moisture.
Whether your youngster has been fully-fledged for some time or is just learning
to walk, you can enjoy the naturally warming and climate-regulating properties
of felted wool throughout the cold season. That’s because Nordwolle produces its
wool regionally here in Germany with a particular emphasis on sustainability.
A wafer-thin rubber ensures that little feet can feel the ground without getting
hurt. A separately available insole offers your little fledgling additional
warmth in its minimal shoe on colder days.
You can switch the aubergine-colored laces for different elastic laces,
available separately, which you can shorten to fit.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
The materials used are dyed in a very gentle and environmentally friendly way,
without chemical additives. As a result, the color of the upper material may
fade and abrasion may create a kind of denim effect.

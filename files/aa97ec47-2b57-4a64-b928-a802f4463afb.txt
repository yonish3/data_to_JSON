Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI MORI 

Short description:
The Tanuki is one of the lightest shoes in the world, and that's not the only
reason it can claim the minimal-shoe label. Its small packing size and
understated design make it a perfect companion, whatever you’re doing: whether
at home, on your travels, in the office, in town or in nature.
This forest-green lowcut is made of stretch washi from the Japanese company
Itoi. Washi is an innovative fabric that consists of 75% paper and 25%
polyester. Thanks to the special weave, your feet only come into contact with
the paper part.
This Tanuki is great for wearing barefoot. Stretch washi has an antibacterial
effect without the need for chemicals. You can also remove the insole for
airing.
As soon as your Tanukis have been worn in, they gently embrace your feet without
getting too tight. Before you wear your Tanukis for the first time, we recommend
that you knead the heel pads a little bit to soften them.
If you want to give your Tanukis a more individual look, you can of course
switch the petrol-colored flat cotton laces for other elastic or cotton laces.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

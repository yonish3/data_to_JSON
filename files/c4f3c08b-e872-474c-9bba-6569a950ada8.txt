Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BEAVER 

Short description:
This intense, dark-blue minimal shoe is made of linen from certified organic
sources. On warm days the Beaver comes into its own with its cooling and
moisture-regulating properties. A good wearing-in makes the upper fabric
wonderfully soft, and the midcut gently cradles your feet.
The integrated climate-regulating insole made of hemp-flax fleece is covered
with a GOTS-certified cotton, and the lining also consists of breathable cotton
from certified organic sources.
The amazingly thin and flexible minimal sole provides all-round freedom of
movement whatever the activity.
For additional color combinations you can switch the beaver-brown flat cotton
laces for other cotton or elastic laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: HERON 

Short description:
The eye-catching green check pattern transforms this simple grey Wildling into
something truly special. Loden made of 100% pure new wool from certified organic
livestock on the outside and high-quality temperature- and moisture-regulating
felted wool from Nordwolle on the inside, promise to keep your feet comfortably
warm in this high cut even throughout the cool season.
The integrated membrane and microfibre padding at the heel offer additional
protection. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first
wearing.
For more individuality, you can switch the emerald green cotton laces for
different colored cotton or elastic laces as you please.
Please note:
The large checked pattern results in different cuts.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

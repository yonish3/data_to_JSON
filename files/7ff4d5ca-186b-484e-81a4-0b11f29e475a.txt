Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Colorado - Water-Ready & Trail-Friendly - Men   Short description: Xero takes you where you want to go   Long description: Product Description  If youג€™re looking for the shoe thatג€™ll handle all of your active lifestyle, the Colorado is for you. Water-friendly, trail-friendlyג€¦ and everything in between. We named this shoe (or is it a sandal?) after our home state, where a single   day can take you from the top of a mountain to rafting down a river. You may recognize a familiar look, but the Colorado is ג€all Xero, all the   time.ג€ Itג€™s flexible. Itג€™s lightweight (it floats!). Youג€™ll love the comfort that   comes from a wide toe box, neoprene lining, and BareFoamג„¢ footbed. And youג€™ll   feel the security of the tire tread-inspired sole (the same as our HFS running   shoe) and wide heel strap. Why youג€™ll love the Colorado    Natural FIT ג€” a wide toe box lets your toes spread, splay, relax, and     function naturally.    Natural MOTION ג€” the Colorado is flexible enough to let your feet bend,     move, and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed to.     The ג€XERO-dropג€ design (non-elevated heel) allows for proper posture, and     itג€™s built low to the ground for balance and agility.    Natural FEEL ג€” the Colorado has a 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole to give you     the right combination of protection plus ground-feedback, so your brain     knows how to move your body optimally.    Light weight ג€” so light, in fact, you could forget you have them on. A     menג€™s 9 is about 7 ounces (each).    Vegan-friendly materials ג€” No animal products are used in the Colorado    5,000 mile sole warranty ג€” like all Xero Shoes, the Colorado is backed     with a 24 month manufacturerג€™s warranty and a 5,000 mile sole warranty.

The Coloradoג€™s heel strap is             a fixed length for extra durability.

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ORIOLE 

Short description:
A flurry of excited shaking and rustling makes the mighty oak tremble. Whistles
and chirrups can be heard from every branch at the top of the tree. A flock of
orioles has found its way here; they hop around boisterously. Their luminous
feathers compete with the bright autumn-red leaves. A swooshing sound announces
the next gust of wind; the forest falls silent. The swooshing sound comes ever
closer; the gusts become stronger. The old oak groans as the wind pulls at its
branches. As one, the flock departs from the tree, numerous yellow dots flying
off to the horizon.
Fly, Wildling, fly! Warm and fleet of foot, the Oriole takes you snug and warm
through the winter. The herringbone pattern gives the golden caramel uppers an
elegant look, which is backed up by the naturally warming and water-resistant
properties of the wool. With feet warmed by soft plush, you'll be well prepared
for the cold time of year.
You can switch the elastic laces for any of our other laces, available
separately.

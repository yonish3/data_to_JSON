Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Casual Women's Canvas Boot   Short description: Super cute. Super comfy.   Long description: Product Description   Let the Vienna take you wherever you want to go Enjoy the Xero Shoes version of a Chelsea-style boot. The low-cut ankle-high   style of the Vienna is perfect for a day at the office or a night on the town. And with Xero Shoesג€™ natural movement design, your feet will be comfortable   no matter where the Vienna takes you. Be prepared, though, to take a bit longer to get where youג€™re going, since   people will stop you to ask, ג€Where did you get those?!ג€ Why youג€™ll love your Vienna:    Natural FIT ג€” A wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the     ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for proper     posture, balance and agility    Natural MOTION ג€” The Vienna is flexible enough to let your feet bend,     move, and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed to.     Plus, theyג€™re so lightweight, youג€™ll barely know you have them on. A womenג€™s     7 is only 8.4 ounces each    Natural FEEL ג€” The Vienna uses our 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® for protection that     lets your feet safely Feel The Worldֲ®    Canvas upper and synthetic toe cap and ankle accents make the Vienna 100%     vegan-friendly    Easy on/off ג€” the wide elastic section makes slipping on the Vienna a     breeze. Theyג€™re easy to take off, tooג€¦ that is if you ever want to take them     off    Barefoot friendly ג€” wear the Vienna with or without socks, and the     removable 2mm insole lets you have more barefoot feeling    Huarache sandal inspired design ג€” the heel strap is not only eye-catching     but functional    5,000-mile sole warranty ג€” like ALL our FeelTrueֲ® soles, the Vienna has     our 5,000-mile sole warranty      a What can I do in the Vienna?  With             itג€™s casual, canvas upper, the Vienna is designed to be a casual             shoe.           a Is the Vienna waterproof?  The             Vienna isnג€™t waterproof. While you can treat the canvas with a             water-proofing spray, the elastic section cannot be similarly             protected.           a How do I find my Vienna size?  The             Vienna runs small. We previously recommend choosing 1 full size             larger than your usual size. However, we recently resized so we now             recommend choosing a half-size larger than your usual size if you             have never had a pair of Viennas.            (If you purchased the Vienna before our resize on August 10th,             2019, then we would recommend going down a half-size instead from             your previous size, as that would line up with the current sizing.)            If our recommendation isnג€™t accurate, we do have an exchange policy.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

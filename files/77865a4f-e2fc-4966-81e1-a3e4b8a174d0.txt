Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI MINTO 

Short description:
Sassy hues for your feet in a limited edition. As a true Tanuki, the upper is
made of stretch washi by Itoi, 75% paper and 25% polyester. Washi is water
permeable and breathable and features natural antibacterial properties, which
make these shoes ideal for wearing barefoot.
The insole can also be removed for easier ventilation.
Add a touch of personal style to your Tanukis by customizing them with laces
that can be purchased separately.
Please note:
Every single shoe is a handmade one of a kind.
The structure and coloration may exhibit minor irregularities.
Extensive wear can create a denim effect of sorts.
This minimalist shoe is water permeable, can even be worn in water, and dries in
a flash.
*Ethylene-vinyl acetate â€“ pollutant-tested, closed-pore orthopedic foam without
plasticizers

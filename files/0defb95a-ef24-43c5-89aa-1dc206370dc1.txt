Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Boaty McBoat Shoe - Women   Short description: Xeroג€™s take on a casual classic   Long description: Product Description   Enjoy the Xero Shoes feeling in our version of a classic Take the cozy comfort of your favorite slipper, and turn that into a boat   shoe. Thatג€™s Boaty McBoat Shoe or Boaty for short. Casual and stylish, Boaty is ready for wherever you take it. Why youג€™ll love your Boaty:    Natural FIT ג€” A wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the     ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for proper     posture, balance and agility    Natural MOTION ג€” The Boaty is flexible enough to let your feet bend, move,     and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed to. Plus,     theyג€™re so lightweight, youג€™ll barely know you have them on. A womenג€™s 7 is     only 6.6 ounces each    Natural FEEL ג€” The Boaty uses our non-marking 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® for     protection that lets your feet safely Feel The Worldֲ®    Canvas upper breathes and gives you a laid-back look and feel    Barefoot friendly ג€” the super-smooth, moisture-wicking lining lets you     wear the Boaty with or without socks, and the removable 2mm insole lets you     have more barefoot feeling    100% vegan-friendly    Huarache sandal inspired design ג€” The heel strap is not only eye-catching     but functional    5,000-mile sole warranty ג€” like ALL our FeelTrueֲ® soles, the Boaty has our     5,000-mile sole warranty  Note: women with especially wide feet may want to consider the ג€menג€™sג€ Boaty.  a What can I do in the Boaty?  While             the design says ג€boat shoeג€ and the non-marking sole can be grippy,             Boaty has a lightly padded canvas upper, so itג€™s not water-repellent             like, say, leather.            You could treat it with a water repellent spray, if you like, but             Iג€™d still not think of Boaty as a ג€water shoe.ג€           a Is the Boaty waterproof?  The             Boaty isnג€™t waterproof. You can treat the canvas with a             water-proofing spray, but since there are drainage holes in the             side, the shoe isnג€™t meant to be waterproof.            And while it can handle water, and dry quickly, itג€™s not the same             type of boat shoe as, say, one made just with a leather upper.           a How do I find my Boaty size?  The             Boaty runs small. We previously recommend choosing 1 full size             larger than your usual size. However, we recently resized so we now             recommend choosing a half-size larger than your usual size if you             have never had a pair of Boaties.            (If you purchased the Boaty before our resize on October 9th, 2019,             then we would recommend going down a half-size instead from your             previous size, as that would line up with the current sizing.)            If our recommendation isnג€™t accurate, we do have an exchange policy.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI YORU 

Short description:
At only 56-151 grams, this night-black minimal shoe is one of the lightest shoes
in the world. This provides a completely new feeling of freedom – like having
bare feet, yet protected. And its small size makes this minimalistic model the
perfect companion for trips and wild adventures in the great outdoors.
The low-cut shoe made of a very special and innovative Japanese Stretch Washi
fabric is 75% paper, temperature-regulating, breathable and quick-drying. Its
25% polyester content,makes the fabric more durable.
Thanks to the material’s anti-bacterial characteristics (a natural effect –
nothing chemical!), the shoes are great for wearing without socks, too.
The paper and polyester are woven in such a way that the synthetic fibre lies on
the outside – your skin itself only comes into contact with the paper – with the
exception of the integrated microfibre padding at the heel. We recommend
kneading the padding to soften it before the first wearing. Wearing your Tanukis
in well makes them even more supple.
Elastic laces, available separately, make the shoes easier to put on.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
Extended use can lead to a kind of denim effect.
This minimal shoe is water-permeable, can be worn in water and dries very
quickly

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: PHEASANT 

Short description:
Just as pheasants disappear in a flash into the high grass, this high quality
minimal shoe helps you dart through fields and meadows towards the spring.
The upper of this light-weight, low-cut shoe in dusky pink is made of pure
organic cotton, with a chequered Panama weave that creates a cheerful denim
effect and has breathable properties.
The cotton lining also comes from certified organic sources and is printed with
an indigo leaf pattern.
Thanks to the paper-thin, dark-red and particularly flexible outsole, you feel
secure when walking and can feel the ground under your feet as if barefoot.
For more individuality you can swap the wide, rosewood-colored cotton laces for
other colors or laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
The fabrics are dyed in a very gentle and environmentally-friendly manner, with
no added chemicals. As a result, the color of the upper material may fade, and
abrasion may create a kind of denim effect with a washed-out look.
Due to the environmentally-friendly print of the lining, some color may rub off
on light-colored socks.

Some people will put them on and wear them all day, right away.            Others will find that too stimulating.            Listen to your body and ג€be your own coach.ג€            Wear them for 20-30 minutes and see how you feel. If that felt             good, add some more time.             If it ever feels like you ג€did too much,ג€ then rest and do a bit             less the next few times you wear them before you increase the amount             of time you have them on (sadly, we never know we ג€did too muchג€             until we, well, do too much נ˜‰ ).           a What if theyג€™re ג€too pointyג€?  For             some people, the Naboso Trail can be too stimulating at first.            No problem. Get a THIN pair of socks and wear those with your             Naboso Trail at first.            When you feel ready, try 5-10 minutes without socks.            Over time, by listening to your body, you can build up the amount             of time and the activities you do in your Naboso Trail sandals.           a Can I wear the Naboso Trail all day?  In             short, yes.            Though it may take you some time to work up to wearing your Naboso               Trail sandals all day.            No need to push yourself. Do whatג€™s comfortable (and, over time,             whatג€™s comfortable will ג€expandג€).           a Where can I learn more about Naboso               Technology?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

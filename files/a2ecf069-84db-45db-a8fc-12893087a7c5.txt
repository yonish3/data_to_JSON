Long description:
The minimalist shoes, Magical Shoes Recovery have been designed for one purpose,
and that is to provide athletes, and specifically runners, with the most
comfortable shoes for before and after their physical activity.
The shoes intend to increase the regeneration speed and relax the hurting feet.
They work perfectly after a long and exhausting run when after taking off our
sports shoes we face such problems as: corns, blisters, swelling, black
toenails, as well as wounds or abrasions.
Thanks to walking in MS Recovery we reduce the tension within the feet and
minimize discomfort.
An equal thickness of the sole under the fingers and heel (zero drop) as well as
a lot of space for the fingers result in that we feel almost barefoot.

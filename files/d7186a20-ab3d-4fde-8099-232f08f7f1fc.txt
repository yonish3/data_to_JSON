Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: CATERPILLAR 

Short description:
A warm autumn wind blows the last leaves aside. Who's hiding here? The little
caterpillar clings to the stalk. Over the last few days, it has fearlessly
explored its little world with great determination. Again and again, it seeks
protection and a safe place to regain its strength. Because it grows a little
every day; every day it discovers something new, every day a little adventure.
Progress step by step.
Now, after the barefoot summer, itâ€™s time for the first minimal shoe. The
Caterpillar protects your little Wildling with a lining of warm plush. This
lightweight shoe with green canvas uppers has a very thin and flexible sole. An
integrated membrane provides additional protection when encountering new worlds
for the first time.
The fir-colored elastic laces make it easier to get into the shoe. Or you can
choose elastic laces in other colors, available separately, which can be
adjusted to fit.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

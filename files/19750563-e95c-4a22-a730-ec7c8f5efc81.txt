A light and lean 11mm ultralight minimalist trail sandal that     provides just the right amount of protection to take the edge off the     trail for a true-to-life minimalist trail experience.    It famously uses a Vibramֲ® soling compound that is super lightweight and     grippy. It won't last as long as the stiffer Oso sole, but what it gives up     in longevity it makes up in performance. The super flexible     Leadville Trail sole will form to your feet like a glove over a short     period of time. It quickly becomes a favorite for its nimbleness and ground     feel.

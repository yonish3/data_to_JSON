Model name: BAREFOOT SHOES EXPLORER SMOOTH ELEGANT 

Short description:
Our flagship model – the Explorer – valued for its multifunctionality and casual
design is respected by people looking for comfortable every-day shoes, as well
as those physically active who search for barefoot experiences.
Extremely flexible and resistant to piercing, the Magical Rubber sole adjusts to
every movement of the foot and ensures maximum contact with the surface.
Strong air mesh combined with natural suede leather do not interfere with our
natural foot motion and allow to feel complete freedom.
Why is Magical Shoes Explorer the most universal minimalist shoe in the world?
-When designing the Explorer model, the main idea was to create a sports shoe
that works in every field. (In which sports would Magical Shoes Explorer work
best)
– Ideally suited as a everyday shoe: for work, for a walk, for shopping, in
everyday activity, because it does not restricts the movement of your feet.
-Thanks to their lightness and flexibility they are the perfect companion to
many expeditions, because after folding they fit into every backpack, purse and
even pocket.
– This is a UNISEX model in sizes from 27EU to 54EU (seriously; D), which is why
they are minimalist shoes for children, women and men.
-Magical Shoes EXPLORER is created in eight different color versions, among
which there were also two fully vegan options, for the production of which we
did not use materials of animal origin.

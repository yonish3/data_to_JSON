Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI YORU 

Short description:
The Japanese tanuki (racoon dog) is a cheery trickster known in Japan as a
shape-shifting master of disguise – adaptable like hardly any other animal.
It's pitch black and is therefore known as “Yoru” (night) in Japanese. Which
adventures will your Tanuki accompany you on where the sun goes down?
This featherweight shoe is made of a very special Japanese material. Stretch
Washi is 70% paper. And its 30% polyester content,makes it more durable. Thanks
to a special weaving technique, the synthetic fibre lies on the outside, so that
the skin itself only comes into contact with the paper. The exception is in the
heel area, where an integrated microfibre heel cushion provides protection. This
shou ld be softened by kneading a little before the first wearing.
Washi is temperature-regulating, breathable and quick-drying. Thanks to the
material’s anti-bacterial characteristics (a natural effect – nothing
chemical!), the shoes are great for wearing without socks, too.
By adding different laces (available separately), you can make the Tanuki your
own.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
Extended use can lead to a kind of denim effect.
This minimal shoe is water-permeable, can be worn in water and dries very
quickly.

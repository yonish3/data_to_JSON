Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Cloud ג€“ Menג€™s Barefoot Sandal   Short description: The freedom of natural barefoot movement, with a whisper of comfort. Feel the Freedom. Feel the Fun. Feel the World!ֲ®   Long description: Product Description  ג€The most comfortable, versatile barefoot sandal your feet will ever love.ג€ Weג€™ve taken our ready-to-wear Venture and added a whisper of comfort with a   custom-made 3mm BareFoamג„¢ insert in the forefoot. This makes the Cloud even lighter and more flexible than the Ventureג€¦ A menג€™s   size 9 is only 4.6 ounces (ea). The Cloud floats!  Some people think of the Cloud as their casual Xero Shoe, even though itג€™s   sturdy enough to tackle a 100-mile trail ultramarathon. Reasons youג€™ll love the Cloud:    Four fun color combinations ג€” Coal Black soles with Charcoal, Mocha Earth     soles with Black, Coal Black soles with Mint or Red    Vegan-friendly materials ג€” the Cloud is made with foam, plastic and nylon    Barefoamג„¢ forefoot insert gives a hint of comfort, without unnecessary     padding    Patent-pending lacing system gives you a perfect fit in seconds    Flatiron pattern on the Barefoamג„¢ gives you extra grip    6mm FeelTrueֲ® outsole protects you from unpleasant surfaces without     sacrificing ground feel    Elegant contour surrounds your foot, but doesnג€™t add unnecessary support    Ready to wear ג€” the lacing is already done for you. Just slide in your     foot and go    Patent-pending tensioning system ג€” find the perfect fit in seconds, and     then you can slide your Xeros on and off in a flash    Super soft toe post ג€” since the huaraches-inspired lacing goes around your     entire foot, you donג€™t feel the toe post the way you do in a flip flop or     other thong sandal    Super STRONG toe post ג€” wonג€™t pull through the sole like flip flops do    Heel cup ג€” keeps your heel in place, helps keep out debris, and adds a     splash of color    Nylon Achilles strap with Silicone grip ג€” holds on securely and     comfortably    Elevated ankle holes ג€” the lace never touches the ground, and so it wonג€™t     abrade    5,000 mile sole warranty! Wear out your Clouds in under 5,000 miles and     weג€™ll replace them for a nominal cost (details here)   a How long will the Xero Shoes               huaraches last?  Frankly, we donג€™t know. Weג€™ve             had people put over 10,000 miles on a pairג€¦ and theyג€™re still going!            Like any shoe, how long they last depends on your running style. If             you use good barefoot technique and are light and easy, without             scraping your foot on the ground, youג€™ll enjoy them for quite a             while.            Besides, considering how inexpensive they are compared to big,             padded, running shoes, we expect that youג€™ll be saving a fortune by             using Xero Shoes.            And, more importantly, Xero Shoes come with a 5,000               mile sole warranty!           a Will running in huaraches (or               barefoot) cure my running problems and injuries?  If             you have a headache because youג€™re hitting yourself on the head with             a hammer, wearing gloves wonג€™t stop the pain.             In other words, itג€™s not just a question of taking off your shoes             and experiencing magical healing powers.             Running barefoot, or in running sandals, gives you a lot of feedback             about your running form. In short, if it hurts, youג€™re probably             doing something wrong.            If you are willing to listen to that feedback and use it as an             opportunity to change the way you run, to adjust your stride, to             find a way to move that doesnג€™t hurt, then thereג€™s a good chance any             problems you had that were caused by bad form sure might clear up.            In other words, barefoot and minimalist running could show you how             to let go of the hammer.             Being barefoot, or in huaraches, is an opportunity to find a cure,             not a cure in and of itself.             Check out this                 post to read about people who, instead, thought             barefoot running was about putting on gloves.           a Can you really run in these things?  Tens             of thousands of people all around the world of all ages use Xero             Shoes for runningג€¦ and walking, hiking, biking, camping, going to             the beach, hitting the gym, doing yoga, even running 100-mile ultra             marathons. Our former Customer Happiness Manager, Bill, ran from his             house to the bus, from the bus stop to the office, back home, and             then around with his dogsג€¦ then he does his fun runs on the weekendג€¦             that was about 120 miles on his Xero Shoes each week!           a Can I change the laces on the Cloud               and Venture?  We donג€™t currently have a way             to let you select different laces when you order, but if youג€™re             adventurous, you can buy extra               laces and swap them out with the ones that come with your             Clouds and Ventures. (Itג€™s actually not that hard to do.)           a Whatג€™s the difference between the               Venture and Cloud Sandals?  The Venture and Cloud are             ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandals.             Both products use our exclusive FeelTrueֲ® rubber, the only outsole             product made specifically for barefoot style sandals.            The Ventureג€™s sole is 5.5mm thick, compared to either 4mm or 6mm on             the DIY kits. The Cloud has 3mm of Barefoamג„¢ in the forefoot for a             bit of extra comfort and lighter weight (the Clouds float!)            The Cloud and Venture have a soft toe post, so thereג€™s no knot             under your foot.            The Cloud and Venture have a simpler lacing system with a             patent-pending adjustment technology that lets you get a perfect fit             in just seconds.            The ankle holes on the Cloud and Venture are raised off the ground             so the lace canג€™t abrade.             The heel cup helps keep stuff from getting under your foot (not             perfectly, of course), and keeps your heel in place.           a I donג€™t like things between my toes!  Okay,             thatג€™s not a question, but Iג€™ll talk about it anyway נ˜‰            Most people who say this are thinking of flip-flops. Xero Shoes are             very different than flip-flops, and people who donג€™t like things             between their toes are usually fine in Xero Shoes.            Whatג€™s the difference?                                                         First, because of the heel strap, Xero Shoes stay on your                   foot comfortably, no matter what youג€™re doing with them. You                   donג€™t need to scrunch your toes to hold them on (like you do                   with a flip-flop).                                                                                                Second, also because of the heel strap, you donג€™t need to                   jam your foot into the toe strap with every step (like a                   flip-flop)                                                                                                Thirdג€¦ Speaking of the toe strap, itג€™s a soft, flexible bit                   of lace, not a hard rubber door stopper (like a you-know-what)                                                                                                And finally, you can adjust the tension of the toe strap,                   unlike aג€¦ Well, you get the idea.                                                  a How do you run in these huaraches               sandals?  Light and easy.            I canג€™t give you a barefoot running lesson here (for that, see the             links on our home page).            But just by wearing them, youג€™ll find quickly that you donג€™t want             to land hard on your heel as you walk or run in Xero Shoes.            The best advice I can give is: play with your gait and stride,             looking for the thing that feels the most comfortable and is the             easiest. But, most importantly: TAKE IT EASY at firstג€¦ remember,             Xero Shoes are just like barefoot, only with protection and style.             If youג€™re not used to walking barefoot, that alone could take some             time to get used to.            Plus, since youג€™re not putting as much stress on your skin when you             wear huaraches, which means it hurts less, itג€™s tempting to do too             much, too far, too fast at first. I know that no matter what I say             youג€™ll probably overdo it (I did). Besides, how do you know what             ג€too muchג€ is, unless you do too much!?            Well, even though thatג€™s true, I recommend you break into your             huaraches SLOWLY. Walk around in them for a while first. Maybe only             a half mile or so. When thatג€™s comfortable, extend the time youג€™re             walking and, when you feel ready, try running. If youג€™re already             running a mile a day, try half a mile in these one day and see how             you feel. Give yourself a day or two off and then repeat. If thatג€™s             not a problem, build up SLOWLY.            I also use the ג€slap-test.ג€ If my sandals are slapping on the             ground when I walk or run, I need to make some kind of change,             probably by not reaching my foot out as far, or using better             posture, etc.           Load More   a Why donג€™t you use leather or hemp               laces?  You can use almost anything             for lacing huaraches.            In my testing, though, I found some issues with hemp and leather             that I didnג€™t like:                         Both leather and hemp tended to stretch, especially when moist              Both leather and hemp tighten and stiffen when they dry              Both leather and hemp wear out faster than our polyester laces              Leather is much more expensive              Most leather laces are rectangular, and the edges can dig into               your skin              Leather, isnג€™t vegan (for those who care about that)              Leather and hemp donג€™t give you as many fun color choices                       The 100% polyester cord we use is strong, light, and doesnג€™t             stretch or tighten, especially when wet.            Also, I prefer the ג€slip-onג€ method of tying which works best with             a round lace, rather than a flat one (like leather).            Needless to say, you can replace the lace we send you with whatever             you like.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BEAVER 

Short description:
It's been raining, streams and rivers are close to overflowing as they gush down
the mountain. The water pulls and tears; after the dark winter months, its power
seems unstoppable; it slurps hungrily at the banks. But the beaver isn't worried
â€“ it has worked hard with its family and the dam is going to hold.
Made of dark-blue, breathable linen from certified organic sources, the Beaver
is ready to join little wildlings on all their adventures.
With its cooling and moisture-absorbing properties, this midcut is the perfect
companion on both mild and warmer days; once worn in it cradles the foot with
supple softness.
The lining with its cross print and the cover of the integrated hemp-flax fleece
insoles are both made of cotton, which also comes from certified organic
sources.
Only 2.5 mm thick, the caramel-colored minimal sole provides flexibility and
unrestricted freedom of movement.
To ring the changes you can switch the beaver-brown, cotton-covered elastic
laces for other elastic or cotton laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: DRAKE 

Short description:
The Drake is a pleasantly warm mid cut in bright emerald green that whisks you
lightly through the urban jungle or winter forests. Its temperature- and
climate-regulating hemp-flax fleece lining keeps you warm even on cold winter
days and does not use any animal materials at all.
This flexible minimal shoe also has an integrated membrane to additionally
protect your feet and is perfect for everyday use as well as special occasions.
microfibre padding on the heel offers additional comfort and protection for the
inner lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first
wearing.
For more variety, you can switch the emerald green cotton laces for different
colored cotton or elastic laces whenever you like.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Why youג€™ll love the Toronto    Natural FIT ג€” a wide toe box lets your toes spread, splay, relax, and     function naturally.

The ג€XERO-dropג€ design (non-elevated heel) allows for proper posture, and     itג€™s built low to the ground for balance and agility.    Natural FEEL ג€” the Toronto has a 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole to give you     the right combination of protection plus ground-feedback, so your brain     knows how to move your body optimally. Also, you can remove the 2mm insole,     for a closer-to-barefoot experience that lets you Feel The Worldֲ®.    Light weight ג€” A womenג€™s 7 is about 8 ounces (each).    Huarache-inspired design ג€” the adjustable heel strap is not just     eye-catching, but functional, giving you a secure and comfortable fit.

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia.

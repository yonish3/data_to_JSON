Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FLYING FOX 

Short description:
The ripe fruit hangs heavy in the evening light. All day long, its bewitching
scent has been attracting the inhabitants of the forest. Flies, caterpillars and
birds feast on its rich sweetness. A satisfied humming fills the air. The beat
of powerful wings silences the goings-on in excited anticipation. A flash of
black tears the fruit from the tree. Richly laden, the flying fox makes its way
homewards; its family gathers round proudly after this first foray.
This flexible minimal shoe is an all-rounder â€“ perfect for both wild adventures
and special occasions. The hemp and flax insole is covered with organic cotton
and regulates temperature and humidity, making the Flying Fox ideal for the last
warm days of summer as well as the cooler months of the year.
A breathable membrane and microfibre padding give protection and comfort. We
recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first wearing.
With an additional insole and a pair of warm socks, the Flying Fox will keep
your feet warm, even on colder days.
Add your own personal touch by swapping the dolphin-blue elastic laces of your
Flying Fox for different elastic or cotton laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

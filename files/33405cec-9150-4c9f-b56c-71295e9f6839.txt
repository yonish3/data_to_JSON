Long description:
The Grizzly model from out autumn collection will work perfectly on colder days.
The mesh has been exchanged for an insulated, breathable synthetic fabric and
the inside of the shoe is made from a soft and pleasant to the touch insulation
blanket.
Our flagship model – the Explorer – valued for its multifunctionality and casual
design is respected by people looking for comfortable every-day shoes, as well
as those physically active who search for barefoot experiences.
Extremely flexible and resistant to piercing, the Magical Rubber sole adjusts to
every movement of the foot and ensures maximum contact with the surface.
Strong artificial leather combined with natural suede leather do not interfere
with our natural foot motion and allow to feel complete freedom.

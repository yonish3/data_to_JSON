Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Jessie - Women's Casual Sandal   Short description: Super simple. Super cute. Super fun.   Long description: Product Description    The Jessie sandal is as fun and multi-faceted as you are.  Cute enough to pair with your favorite outfit. Rugged enough to pull out of your backpack and   use as a camp shoe. Eye-catching enough that you may not make it down   the street without someone stopping you to chat. With its simple toe strap and secure, Velcro ankle strap, the Jessie will let   you do whatever you want to do. Itג€™s meant to be a casual sandal, but if you have to break into a quick   sprint, itג€™ll handle that, too. Why ג€Jessieג€? Our product designerג€™s wife, Jessie, used our DIY sandal kit to develop the   design that inspired this sandal, and weג€™re proud to honor and thank her for   it with this namesake sandal.

Although             our Jessie is a more casual sandal you can still do practically             anything in them. Take a walk on the beach, a hike in the woods,             hang out with friend, stroll around the campsite, dance your heart             out! Pretty much anything you want.            Iג€™m not sure that the Jessie, or any sandal for that matter, is             right for lateral motion sports, like tennis or basketball.            So, use your common sense and HAVE FUN!

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: DAISY 

Short description:
It's as if they’ve been dabbed on to the meadow with a thick paintbrush.
Thousands of little white dots, growing together to form ever larger patches.
They lie there like a soft blanket, inviting you to rest a while in this gentle
summer meadow. We come past and pick a little daisy.
The feet of the very littlest walkers are also delicate like daisies. So their
first shoes should offer protection, while providing all the room they need to
develop.
The Daisy’s upper is made of a pleasantly soft and robust cotton, 100% from
certified organic sources and with its extremely thin, only 1 mm sole, it lets
little ones step out safely to experience their surroundings.
The light-blue cotton laces can be switched for other colors, available
separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

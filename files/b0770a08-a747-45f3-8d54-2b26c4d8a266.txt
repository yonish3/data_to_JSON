Short description:
Breathable, cooling linen and robust, moisture-regulating hemp make this minimal
shoe a perfect companion, particularly on warmer days.
The integrated hemp-flax fleece insole covered with GOTS-certified cotton helps
create a comfortable foot climate.
With its incredibly thin and flexible outsole, this minimal shoe gives you full
freedom of movement, whatever youâ€™re doing.
The light-blue cotton laces from certified organic sources can be switched for
other cotton or elastic laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

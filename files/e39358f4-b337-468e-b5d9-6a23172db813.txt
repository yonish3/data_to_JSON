Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BAT 

Short description:
The bat pokes its little head out of the cave and sniffs. Slowly, the leaves are
beginning to fall from the trees and itâ€™s getting cold and damp. The bat spreads
its wings and flies a final circuit. Soon it will migrate to its winter
quarters.
The flexible materials of this minimal shoe for children made of robust organic
cotton and thick untreated felted wool from Nordwolle allow natural freedom of
movement during even the wildest adventures. The integrated membrane protects
feet in autumn and on wonderful winter days.
The Bat model is enhanced by seams and elastic laces in bright blue; or you can
try other laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FALCON 

Short description:
Its favourite place is the old fence post down in the meadow. Sitting serenely in
the sunshine, it warms its limbs, gathering new strength for the day. The wild
meadow is its kingdom. Any tension remains well hidden; at the highest point of
its concentration it rockets skywards, powerful wings beating the air. Its
glossy plumage bathes in the golden rays of the sun. Another colossal circuit,
then the falcon disappears behind the tops of the trees.
Wool inside, wool outside â€“ keeping you warm! Your feet stay protected thanks to
the water-resistant properties of this wonderful natural material and the
integrated membrane. The falcon takes you through the winter with comfy feet.
Microfibre padding at the heel provides additional comfort and protects the
lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first wearing.
You can switch the elastic laces for other laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

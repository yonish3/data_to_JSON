Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI SUNA 

Short description:
You open your bag. Your clothes and book have soaked up the warmth and scent of
the sun and the sea. Carefully you pick up one item after another, enjoying the
vividness of the memory. Your Tanuki Sunas, with the color and lightness of
sand, are the last things to appear. You quickly slip into them, and this time
you enjoy the little stones and the sand that await your feet.
This featherweight low-cut shoe made of stretch Washi from the Japanese company
Itoitex caresses your feet like a second skin. When you wear this minimal shoe,
its innovative paper and polyester construction gives an incomparable feeling of
lightness. As the Washi is breathable and water-permeable with anti-bacterial
properties (natural, not chemical), Tanuki Suna (“sand”) is the perfect
companion for wild summer adventures. The insole is there to protect bare feet
and can be taken out to help the shoes dry more quickly.
Microfibre padding at the heel provides additional comfort. We recommend
kneading the padding to soften it before the first wearing.
You can swap the silver-grey cotton laces for other colors or colored elastic
laces as the mood takes you.
Please note:
Due to the environmentally-friendly print on the insole, colors may rub off. We
therefore recommend bearing that in mind when choosing which socks to wear.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
Extensive wearing may create a kind of denim effect with a washed-out look.
This minimal shoe is water-permeable, can be worn in water and dries very
quickly.

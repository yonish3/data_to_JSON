Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FLORA 

Short description:
This minimal shoe with a zip is a real Wildling classic. It recalls the first
Wildling models and yet comes in a completely new look. The leaf pattern was
designed exclusively in the fox’s den. With this indigo-blue print on sage-green
organic cotton you’ll have real eye-catchers on your feet.
The integrated insole made of temperature-regulating hemp-flax fleece is covered
with organic cotton to ensure a pleasant feel.
The microfibre padding gives your heel added comfort while protecting the lining
from wear and tear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
You can swap the petrol-colored cotton laces for other colors or colored elastic
laces as the mood takes you.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of natural materials.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

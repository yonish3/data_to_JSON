Manufacturer: Vibram 5F  Model name: KSO WOMEN'S   Short description: The KSO is arguably our most successful FiveFinger to date, mainly due to its versatility. We added this back into the mix a few years back to celebrate the rebirth of a legend. When you're scrambling up a rocky bluff or bounding along a riverbank, the last thing you want is gravel and grit seeping into your FiveFingers. So why not Keep Stuff Out! The KSO has a snug fit, one of our most minimal sole constructions for maximum ground feel, and a breathable, quick drying upper. The KSO also features a thin, abrasion resistant stretch polyamide and breathable stretch mesh that wraps your entire foot to do just that. A single hook-and-loop closure helps secure the fit. Non-Marking XS Trek performance rubber soles are razor-siped for sure grip.   Long description: WEIGHT: Men's 43: 5.9 oz., Women's 38: 4.71 oz.

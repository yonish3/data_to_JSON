Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Veracruz - The Invisible Sport Sandal"" - Men   Short description: A radical reinvention in sandal comfort   Long description: Product Description Imagine a sport sandal with traction to take you wherever you want, with an ''invisible'' feeling like no other. That?s the Veracruz. Our Chief Product Officer, Dennis Driscoll, literally dreamed the Veracruz   into existence ? he had to wake himself up to sketch this completely unique   (and, now, patented) minimalist sport sandal webbing pattern. Like our Jessie, the Veracruz has a comfortable, slightly stretchy, woven toe   loop. And like our Z-Trail sandal, you?ll find a 3-layer FeelLite? sole with:    FeelTrue? rubber inserts for grip ? including a new, more rugged tread     under the ball of your foot    A TrailFoam? middle layer to ''even out the bumps''    The BareFoam? footbed with just enough cushion for comfort and performance    Of course, the sole is backed with our 5,000 mile sole warranty  It?s the upper webbing pattern that?s so special ? the strap that starts at   the outside of your foot and loops around to become the heel strap, plus the   separate instep strap. Both are adjustable to get the right fit. There?s something magical about the strapping system combined with the toe   loop and the light weight (just 4.8 ounces for a men?s 9) that makes the   Veracruz feel like there?s nothing on your foot. But the grippy outsole lets   you know it?s ready for adventure. NOTE: Since there?s nothing else like the Veracruz in the world, we     want to hear your thoughts and feedback about it. After you get your     Veracruz, email or call us with any questions. Fit instructions With this new webbing system, you may wonder how to get in and out of the   Veracruz.

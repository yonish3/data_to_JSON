Long description:
Children’s barefoot shoes Magical Shoes LULU are created especially for little,
barefoot explorers whose feet will move freely on each ground. Produced for
learning to walk properly, they do not block the natural development of feet and
imitate barefoot walking. The LULU model can also be described as healthy shoes
for children, because children who walk in barefoot shoes strengthen muscles of
their small feet, do not deform them and ensure the correct body posture.
Hand-made of natural cowhide protect a toddler’s foot from any scratch. The thin
3.5 mm Magical Rubber sole is incredibly flexible, bends in every direction and
is highly resistant to wearing. The leather lining is safe for a child’s
delicate skin, does not cause abrasions and allows the child’s feet to breathe
freely.

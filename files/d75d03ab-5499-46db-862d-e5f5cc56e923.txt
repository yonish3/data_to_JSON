Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Prio Running and Fitness Shoe - Kids   Short description: Durable, versatile, natural. Let your kids Live Life Feet First!   Long description: Product Description Now Xero Shoes are ready for you for KIDS! You probably know how important it is to let your kidsג€™ feet develop and   function naturally ג€” letting their toes spread, and their feet bend, flex, move, and Feel the World!ֲ® Thatג€™s why weג€™re thrilled to release the Kidג€™s version of our     best-selling Prio barefoot/minimalist shoe for everything they love   to do. The Kidsג€™ Prio has everything you love about the adult version, plus weג€™ve   made a few changes, just for them:    More grip! We spaced out the lugs and made them bigger on     the FeelTrueֲ® soles to give them better traction.    Ergonomic fit We didnג€™t just shrink the adult Prio, we     changed the shape for a better fit.    Just-right feedback We also thinned out the sole a little     bit to make it extra flexible, give kids the right amount of ground-feel and     protection.    Unisex fit Donג€™t worry about boys vs. girls, the Kids     Prio is made for both.  Of course, weג€™ve kept all the best things about the Prio:    Natural FIT ג€” A wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the     ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for proper     posture, balance, and agility    Natural MOTION ג€” The Prio is flexible enough to let little feet bend,     move, and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed    Lightweight ג€” Your kids might even forget theyג€™re wearing them    Natural FEEL ג€” Remove the 2mm insole for a more ג€barefoot feel,ג€ or keep     it in for a bit more protection    100% Vegan-friendly materials ג€” No animal products are used in the Prio    Huarache-inspired design ג€” The huarache-sandal inspired strap helps secure     the heel    Adjustable instep strap ג€” Use the ג€inverted Vג€ straps arenג€™t sewn down to     lock in the instep while keeping toes free to move    Reflective straps ג€” The middle strip in the heel and instep straps are     highly reflective for evenings and night    Barefoot-friendly ג€” Wear the Prio with or without socks    5,000-mile sole warranty ג€” like all our FeelTrueֲ® soles, the Prio is     backed by our 5,000-mile sole warranty*  A note about sizing The numbers for kids sizes change. The ג€Kids 12ג€ is the smallest size,   followed by Kids 13, then Youth 1-4. Worried about your kids outgrowing the Prio? We know that kids grow, and weג€™re not fans of buying shoes ג€that theyג€™ll grow   into.ג€ To help out if your kids get too big for their Prio, weג€™ve created a Facebook   Group where you can trade/swap/buy/sell your shoes and pass your   still-wearable pair to someone who still fits your size, and find a pair for   the next perfect fit. (Note: The FB group is for use at your own discretion. The deals you make are   up to you.) *5,000 mile sole warranty is non-transferable and only valid for the original   purchaser of the shoes.

The             Prio             is an ג€all-aroundג€ shoe. Itג€™s good for walking, running, hiking,             playing, climbingג€¦ you name it.           a Should my children wear these with               or without socks?  Thatג€™s totally up to you (or             them).            The Prio is made so they can be worn with or without socks.           a How do I pick the right size?  The             Kids Prio is ג€true to size,ג€ so select the typical size for your             child.            Now, that said, sizing is not a science, thereג€™s a lot of personal             preference involvedג€¦ Three people with identical feet will have             three opinions about how the same shoe fits נ˜‰            If the size you get doesnג€™t fit, take advantage of our free             domestic exchange policy. See https://xeroshoes.com/return-policy/             for details.           a How do the straps work in the Prio?  All             the straps ג€” the heel and instep ג€” are adjustable for a secure,             comfy fit.            To use the instep straps, simply tighten or loosen them with the             tension of the lace that goes through them.            For the heel strap, itג€™s best to adjust it by gently sliding it             through the ג€wingג€ in the sole rather than yanking on it.            a Are these waterproof?  The             Kids Prio isnג€™t waterproof. But the breathable mesh should dry             quickly.           a If my child outgrows these, then               what?  We know that children have a             habit of growing.            Weג€™ve created a Facebook group where you can find other ג€Prio             parentsג€ with who you can trade/swap/sell/buy.

Please             go to Xero Shoes               Return Policy page to learn about our 45-day return             policy.           a Do you ship internationally?  We             do! Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

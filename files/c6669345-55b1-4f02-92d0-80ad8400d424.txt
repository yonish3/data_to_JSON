Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI MINTO 

Short description:
A hot summer’s day. A gentle breeze rustles through the dunes. The crystal clear
water sparkles in hues of mint green, and from time to time, muted ripples from
small waves wash onto the beach. Laughter rings out as wild feet race into the
cool shallows. Water splashes in every direction. What a refreshing cool-down.
With its breezy light material and cool color, Minto makes sure feet stay fresh
on hot days.
Like all models from the Tanuki range, Minto is made of stretch washi by Itoi
and is composed of 75% paper and 25% polyester. Washi is a breathable,
water-permeable, quick-drying material that boasts a natural antibacterial
effect. That makes this shoe ideally suited for barefoot wear.
For faster drying, we recommend removing the insole.
Add a touch of personal style to your Tanukis by customizing them with laces
that can be purchased separately.
Please note:
Every single shoe is a handmade one of a kind.
The structure and coloration may exhibit minor irregularities.
Extensive wear can create a denim effect of sorts.
This minimalist shoe is water permeable, can even be worn in water, and dries in
a flash.
*Ethylene-vinyl acetate – pollutant-tested, closed-pore orthopedic foam without
plasticizers

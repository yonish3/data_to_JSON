Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TARPAN 

Short description:
A low cut that keeps wild feet warm even on cold days. With its temperature- and
humidity-regulating lining made of felted wool from Nordwolle and the
satin-brushed upper material made of robust cotton from controlled organic
sources, the Tarpan is the perfect companion for any occasion.
The integrated membrane and a microfibre pad on the heel offer additional
protection and comfort.
The dark-blue linen flat laces can be substituted with other colored cotton or
elastic laces for a more individual look.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

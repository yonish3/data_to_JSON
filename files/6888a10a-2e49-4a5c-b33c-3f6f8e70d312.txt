Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FEATHER INDIGO 

Short description:
Gently it rustles in the summer wind. Lovingly it caresses the bright blue
plumage and beckons you to take to the skies, enticing you with its summery
lightness.
Come, lovely Feather – let’s fly.
Indigo Feather is a feathery light sandal for Wildlings on a journey of
discovery, ready to embark on any adventure.
Made of indigo blue microfiber, the upper is particularly robust and pliable. As
with the closed Wildlings, the thin and flexible outsole is made of a
rubber-cork blend.
The breathable mid-sole is composed of washi by Itoi. This lightweight material
is quick-drying and has natural antibacterial properties. The insole is securely
integrated into the sandal and cannot be removed, so that little feet have
better footing inside the sandal.
The Wildling children’s sandal offers plenty of room to move and, weighing in at
around just 40–100 g, is a real featherweight. The closed strap over the big toe
actively supports the so-called windlass mechanism. Through the natural movement
of the big toe, the sandal clings to the foot on its own during all kinds of
play and frolic.
The flexible and pliable Velcro closure allows the Feather to conform to the
unique shape of any paw, and countless micro-velcro hooks will stand up to all
kinds of wild activities.
IMPORTANT:
Please follow the fitting guidelines for finding your size, as the correct
sandal size will differ from your normal Wildling size!

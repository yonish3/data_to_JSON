Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).

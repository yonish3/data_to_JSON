Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BUZZARD 

Short description:
The Buzzard spreads its wings and glides through the bitterly cold air. He’s
completely free up here. A breath of wind makes him rise higher and higher, and
he can see exactly what’s happening on the ground. Nothing remains hidden from
his gaze.
Cosy warm wool inside and out makes this minimal shoe the perfect companion for
your little Wildling on winter voyages of discovery.
The untreated wool in light and dark brown herringbone from Nordwolle has both
warming as well as temperature- and climate-regulating properties and also
protects little paws and the integrated membrane even on long adventures.
A microfibre padding on the heel offers additional comfort and protection for
the inner lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
The brown Tencel®-covered elastic laces can be switched for different colored
cotton or elastic laces.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: LITTLE WOLF 

Short description:
The brave Little Wolf is full of curiosity as it roams through the forest. What
wonders await it here? Its coat shimmers grey and soft among the last of the
leaves. On silent paws it pads over the moss, leaving slight impressions in the
soft earth. After a short rest beneath the ancient tree, the little wolf starts
to run. Is it wanting to go back to its cave now? Or to be off on the next wild
adventure?
The Little Wolf keeps small paws especially warm with a double layer of felted
wool and a higher shaft. Thanks to the climate-regulating properties of the
natural, untreated felted wool from Nordwolle, which is regionally produced in
Germany with a particular emphasis on sustainability, it is the ideal boot for
little children's feet.
If the Little Wolf is the first learn-to-walk shoe for your little one, then
during the cold season you’ll be glad of the naturally warming and
climate-regulating properties of wool. Whether being carried by Mum or Dad,
sitting or lying in a pram, or discovering the cold season on their own two
legs, little explorers will love wearing this shoe. And the integrated membrane
protects their feet.
A paper-thin rubber sole of 1 mm ensures that your child’s feet feel and make
contact with the ground without getting hurt.
The laces can be switched for elastic laces in other colors, available
separately.
Please note:
Due to the small size of the shoe, the fox label is printed on this model.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item whose upper is made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

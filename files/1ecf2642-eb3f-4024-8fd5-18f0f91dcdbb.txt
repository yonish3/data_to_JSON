Best friends don’t always make the best travel companions. At home, it might sound like a good idea to spend two weeks road tripping with your bestie around the West Coast or exploring Europe by rail. But on vacation, you learn a lot about a person. For example, it can be awfully frustrating to find your best pal snoring when you’re ready to be out there exploring, and just imagine how they feel when you tell them you want to jump out of a plane and all they want to do is jump into the hotel pool. In fact, nearly half (50%) of millennial travelers have had a bad travel companion. Almost 40% of other travelers have, too and 48% say that personality differences have ruined a trip. The way each of us travels isn’t wrong of course, but knowing up front whether or not you’re travel compatible can save a lot of heartache. Based on survey data, we created the following quiz to help you find your vacation soulmate.

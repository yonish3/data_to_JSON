Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: HFS - Lightweight Road Running Shoe - Women   Short description: Set your feet free!   Long description: Product Description  A new lightweight, breathable mesh upper, a new tire tread-inspired sole, a silky moisture wicking lining made with ג€37.5ג€ material, protected tension strapsג€¦ put all of that together for your new favorite road running shoe, the HFS. Of course, we know youג€™ll do much more than just run down   your favorite roads in the HFS (and we canג€™t wait to see pics of where it   takes you and what you do in it!) Why ג€HFS?ג€ Well, it could be for the ג€Highly Flexible Soleג€   that lets your foot move naturally, or the face youג€™ll make when you put it on   ג€” ג€Happy Face Shoeג€ ג€” or way you run it it with a ג€High   Frequency Strideג€, or what you exclaim when you put it on and   feel the comfort and light weight: ג€Holy ___ ___!ג€ There are as many possible answers as there are things youג€™ll do in the HFS. Why youג€™ll love the HFS    Natural FIT ג€” a wide toe box lets your toes spread, splay, relax, and     function naturally.    Natural MOTION ג€” the HFS is flexible enough to let your feet bend, move,     and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed to. The     ג€XERO-dropג€ design (non-elevated heel) allows for proper posture, and itג€™s     built low to the ground for balance and agility.    Natural FEEL ג€” the HFS has a 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole to give you the     right combination of protection plus ground-feedback, so your brain knows     how to move your body optimally. Also, you can remove the 2mm insole, for a     closer-to-barefoot experience that lets you Feel The Worldֲ®.    Light weight ג€” so light, in fact, you could forget you have them on. A     womenג€™s 7 is about 5.8 ounces (each).    Huarache-inspired design ג€” the adjustable instep and midfoot straps are     not just eye-catching but functional, giving you a secure and comfortable     fit.    Vegan-friendly materials ג€” No animal products are used in the HFS    5,000 mile sole warranty ג€” like all Xero Shoes, the HFS is backed with a     24 month manufacturerג€™s warranty and a 5,000 mile sole warranty.

The Prio is our best-selling             ג€do almost anythingג€ shoe ג€” running, hiking, working out, you name             it.            The Speed Force is our lightest, ג€most barefootג€ shoe.            HFS is lighter than the Prio, more rugged than the Speed Force.            The HFSג€™s sole has a new tire tread-inspired sole thatג€™s made to             handle roads and have extra traction.            The huarache-inspired midfoot and instep straps are ג€hidingג€ behind             a protective welded material.             And the lining using ג€37.5ג€ material, which is designed for extra             moisture wicking.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).

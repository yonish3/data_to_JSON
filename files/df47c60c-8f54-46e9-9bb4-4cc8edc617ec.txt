Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: LAMB 

Short description:
The lamb jumps around in the hay while a cold winter wind blows outside. Suddenly
it hears a howling wolf from afar. Quickly it snuggles into its mother’s warm
fur and is very glad to be in the safety of the fold.
In brown canvas made of robust organic cotton, this winter boot is ready for any
adventure.
Together with the integrated membrane, the polyester plush lining warms and
protects little feet.
The seams and elastic laces provide contrast in dark blue; additional cotton
laces are included in the package or you can go for some of our other laces,
available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

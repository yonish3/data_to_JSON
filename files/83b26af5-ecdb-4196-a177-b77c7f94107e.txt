Long description:
Leather sandals Magical Shoes COCO are a perfect solution for spring and summer
for little explorers. Designed for learning of proper walking, they are aimed to
imitate barefoot walking, so they do not block the natural development of feet.
The COCO model can also be described as healthy shoes for children, because
children who walk in barefoot shoes strengthen muscles of their small feet, do
not deform them and ensure the correct body posture. Made by hand from natural
cowhide, from local producers, they protect a toddlerâ€™s foot from every scratch
and provide comfort. A thin 3.5 mm sole Magical Rubber is incredibly flexible,
bends in every direction and is very resistant to wearing. The leather lining
does not cause abrasions and is safe for delicate skin of a child. Thanks to
hand-punched holes they are very airy and are an excellent offer for children on
scorching days.

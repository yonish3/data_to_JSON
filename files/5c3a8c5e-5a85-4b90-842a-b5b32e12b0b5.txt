Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: DRAKE 

Short description:
The Drake quacks excitedly and shakes his feathers. It has become cold by the
pond. He proudly puffs out his chest and chases away the heavily wrapped,
inquisitive visitors. Then he paddles back to his family, who are so engrossed
in dabbling up tails all that they didn’t even notice his adventures.
The pleasantly warm Drake in a bright emerald green is a light-footed companion
for your little ducklings through the urban jungle and on every forest and
meadow adventure.
Its cotton-coated, temperature- and climate-regulating hemp-flax fleece lining
keeps you warm even on cold winter days and does not use any animal materials at
all.
This flexible minimal shoe also protects young feet with its integrated membrane
and microfibre padding at the heel. We recommend kneading the padding to soften
it before the first wearing.
For more variety, you can also switch the Tencel®-covered elastic laces for
different colored cotton or elastic laces whenever you please.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

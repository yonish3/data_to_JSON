Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: AURORA 

Short description:
This minimal shoe has kept a glimmer of summer sunshine for you. Aurora also
imparts warmth during the grey days of autumn. Thanks to the climate-regulating
properties of the untreated felted wool from Nordwolle and the integrated
membrane, this high-cut shoe keeps your feet cosily warm and dry. Nordwolle
manufacture regionally in Germany with a particular emphasis on sustainable
production.
The microfibre padding gives your heel added comfort while protecting the lining
from wear and tear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
You can swap the berry-coloured cotton laces if you like for different coloured
laces or elastic laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and colour.

Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Mesa Trail - Men's Lightweight Trail Runner   Short description: Ready for adventure   Long description: Product Description  Youג€™ll practically fly over your next trail when youג€™re wearing the Mesa Trail. We made the Mesa Trail with lightweight, barefoot-friendly, minimalist   running in mind. But we know youג€™ll wear it off-trail too. Youג€™ll look great when you pair the Mesa Trail with your favorite jeans, and   is comfortable enough for all-day wear. The breathable, mesh upper gets rid of the weight and keeps you cool. The   moisture wicking ג€37.5ג€ lining helps keep you dry. The welded protective   covering of the adjustable midfoot and instep straps adds durability. The   lugged, dual-chevron tread gives you sure-footed traction. And the ג€hiddenג€   3mm TrailFoamג„¢ layer adds the right amount of protection and comfort. Why youג€™ll love the Mesa Trail    Natural FIT ג€” a wide toe box lets your toes spread, splay, relax, and     function naturally.    Natural MOTION ג€” the Mesa Trail is flexible enough to let your feet bend,     move, and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed to.     The ג€XERO-dropג€ design (non-elevated heel) allows for proper posture, and     itג€™s built low to the ground for balance and agility.    Natural FEEL ג€” the Mesa Trail has a 5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole, with 3.5mm     lugs to give you the right combination of protection and grip, plus     ground-feedback so your brain knows how to move your body optimally. Also,     you can remove the 2mm insole, for a closer-to-barefoot experience that lets     you Feel The Worldֲ®.    Light weight ג€” so light, in fact, you could forget you have them on. A     menג€™s 9 is about 7.6 ounces (each).    Huarache-inspired design ג€” the adjustable instep and midfoot straps are     not just eye-catching but functional, giving you a secure and comfortable     fit.    Vegan-friendly materials ג€” No animal products are used in the Mesa Trail    5,000 mile sole warranty ג€” like all Xero Shoes, the Mesa Trail is backed     with a 24 month manufacturerג€™s warranty and a 5,000 mile sole warranty.

The TerraFlex is our first             shoe designed for trails. With a rugged, stitched upper, itג€™s great             for running and hiking.             The Mesa Trail is made more specifically for trail running, with a             lightweight breathable mesh upper, extra moisture wicking with the             ג€37.5ג€ lining, and a protective welded covering for the adjustable             midfoot and instep straps.            Both shoes have a grippy, lugged, dual-chevron tread, and a 3mm             TrailFoam layer (ג€hidingג€ in the outsole) for just-right protection             and comfort.

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).

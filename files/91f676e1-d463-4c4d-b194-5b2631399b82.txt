Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ROBIN 

Short description:
With a happy, joyful song, the robin hops from stick to stone, from stone to
stick. Finding the last berries on the bush, he proudly lifts his voice to sing.
He cleans his fine red coat in the pure, clear brook and delights in the wild
drops as they splash over the stones. The sun sets, and the banks of the river
fade away in the twilight. Tired and happy, the little robin jumps back into his
warm nest.
With a fine layer of plush, the Robin warms little feet. The flexible sole of
this minimal shoe for tiny tots helps them to feel the ground and protects their
tender feet as they take their tentative first steps. A membrane incorporated
inside the shoe keeps it dry on its wild journeys of discovery.
To vary the colour combination, you can switch the laces for elastic laces,
available separately, which you can shorten to fit.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

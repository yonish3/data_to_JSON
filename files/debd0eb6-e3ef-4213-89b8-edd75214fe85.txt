Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FEATHER INDIGO 

Short description:
Light as a feather, little feet leap across a summer meadow. Between the sunny
yellow buttercups and the delicate violet of the blossoming lady’s smock,
Feather’s spirited indigo blue twinkles in the sunlight, adding its own note to
the sumptuous summer symphony.
This Wildling sandal now offers breezy lightness for even the smallest feet.
Weighing less than 30g, the Feather offers novice walkers maximum freedom of
movement. The closed strap protects tender toes and, together with the extremely
slim minimum sole, allows total flexibility for every move.
To ensure ample protection and a better fit, the heel area is closed and a loop
provides convenient slip-on assistance.
The flexible and supple micro-velcro closure conforms to the varied contours of
little paws.
IMPORTANT:
Please follow the fitting guidelines for finding your size, as the correct
sandal size will differ from your normal Wildling size!

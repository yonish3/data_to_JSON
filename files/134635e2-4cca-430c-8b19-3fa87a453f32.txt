Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BLACKBERRY 

Short description:
Juicy and fragrant, the last blackberries hang from the bushes and tell of the
summer gone by. The numerous prickles vainly try to keep the cool days away. All
around is a harmonious humming of busy bumblebees.
These colorful minimal shoes in a vibrant Bordeaux red and rich navy blue will
not let delicate paws down, even during winter adventures, thanks to the
high-quality pure new wool from certified organic livestock. The felted wool
lining from Nordwolle and integrated membrane provide cosy warmth and
protection. The lining is not only warm but also regulates the climate and
humidity.
A microfibre padding on the heel offers the feet of your little Wildlings and
the inner lining additional protection. We recommend kneading the padding to
soften it before the first wearing.
For more variety, you can switch the blue Tencel®-coated elastic laces for
different colored cotton or elastic laces whenever you fancy.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ROSE RED 

Short description:
These bright red high cut adds a splash of color to the darker time of year. Rose
Red is a velvety-soft all-year shoe and has a higher shaft than its predecessor
model, Red Riding Hood. A real eye catcher. On cooler days you can wear your
Rose Reds with an additional insole and thick socks. And the integrated membrane
protects your feet.
The microfibre padding gives your heel added comfort while protecting the lining
from wear and tear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
You can switch the Bordeaux-colored laces for any of our other laces, available
separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

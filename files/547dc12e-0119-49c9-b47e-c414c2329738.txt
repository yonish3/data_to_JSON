Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: BLACKBERRY 

Short description:
Beautifully warm, this Wildling in Bordeaux red and navy blue herringbone not
only brings color into your life.
Thanks to the climate- and temperature-regulating properties of the untreated
Nordwolle, this mid cut will keep you warm through even the coldest days.
Outside, the finest herringbone from 100% virgin wool from controlled organic
animal husbandry is particularly impressive. And inside, the high-quality felted
wool lining and integrated membrane provide additional protection for your feet.
Padding on the heel offers additional comfort and protection for the inner
lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before wearing for the
first time.
For a more personalised look, the blue Tencel® laces can be switched for
different colored cotton or elastic laces.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

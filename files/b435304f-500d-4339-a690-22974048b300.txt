These toe spacers are created by the Correct Toes company.  They
    can be worn inside Lems Shoes during activity.  It is recommended to
    remove the insole of the shoe in order to create ample space inside the toe
    area.  Wearing Correct Toes during activity can increase the
    re-aligning effect of the toes back to their natural position. They can be
    worn during running, walking, and hiking to spread and strengthen the toes
    naturally.  Also, Correct Toes naturally help reverse the effects
    of bunions and hammer toes. Correct Toes are the World's only
    toe spacer designed to be worn inside footwear. They're great for runner's
    that want a healthier toe splay to improve balance, and to properly spread
    the toes upon foot strike.

 

Re-aligning Transition Period

 

Correct Toes have been tested and proven by hundreds of patients to
    re-align the toes and straighten the big Toe, however, a proper re-aligning
    period must be accounted for.  The time period varies based on how
    often and how long they are worn, and how quickly the toes of
    the individual responds to them.  Most individuals will
    notice wider spaces between their toes after about 4 weeks when worn for
    several hours every other day.  For patients that are trying
    to straighten the big toe from the effects of bunions, the Correct
    Toes need to be worn regularly for several months.  Some severe toe
    deformities may never be completely corrected, however Correct Toes will
    improve the alignment of your toes when you dedicate proper
    time each week until you are satisfied with your new natural toe spread.

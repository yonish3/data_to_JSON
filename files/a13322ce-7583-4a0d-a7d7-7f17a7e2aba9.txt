Long description: Product Description The simplest, most versatile sandal your feet will ever love.  Weג€™ll let Xero Shoes expert, Randy Kreill, tell you about the Genesis:  Itג€™s called the Genesis because it was inspired by our first product, our DIY sandal kit, and one of mankindג€™s first footwear designs. Then, of course, we updated it with the experience weג€™ve had and feedback weג€™ve gotten, from making barefoot-friendly sandals since 2009. Start enjoying your Xero Shoes Genesis just moments after they arrive in your   mailbox. Why youג€™ll love the Genesis:    The right combination of barefoot-friendly ground feel plus protection,     thanks to our exclusive 5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber outsoles    Elegant contour to hold your foot, but without unnecessary support    Lightweight ג€“ Womenג€™s 7 is only 4 ounces each    Pre-laced ג€” just slide in your foot and go    Patent-pending tension adjustment system ג€” find the perfect fit in     seconds, and then you can slide your Xeros on and off in a flash    Super soft toe loop ג€” since the huaraches-inspired lacing goes around your     entire foot, you donג€™t feel the toe loop the way you do in     many flip-flops or other thong sandals    Nylon Achilles strap with Silicone grip ג€” holds on securely and     comfortably    Elevated ankle holes ג€” the lace never touches the ground, and so it wonג€™t     abrade    Trim to fit ג€” with just kitchen scissors, you can trim the Genesis to     match your foot shape    Vegan-friendly    5,000-mile sole warranty! (Details here).      a Can I change the laces in the               Genesis?  We donג€™t currently have a way             to let you select different laces when you order, but if youג€™re             adventurous, you can buy extra               laces and swap them out with the ones that come with your             Genesis (itג€™s pretty simple to do).           a Whatג€™s the difference between the               Genesis, Cloud, and your DIY kits?  The             Genesis and Cloud are ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandals. For             our kits you, well, have to make them נ˜‰            Both products use our exclusive FeelTrueֲ® rubber, the only outsole             product made specifically for barefoot style sandals.            The Genesisג€™s sole is 5mm thick, compared to either 4mm or 6mm on             the DIY kits. The Cloud has 3mm of Barefoamג„¢ in the forefoot for a             bit of extra comfort and lighter weight (the Clouds float!)            The Cloud and Genesis have a toe loop, so thereג€™s no knot under             your foot.            The Cloud and Genesis have a simpler lacing system with a patented             adjustment technology that lets you get a perfect fit in just             seconds.            The ankle holes on the Cloud and Genesis are raised off the ground             so the lace canג€™t abrade.           Load More   a Why donג€™t you use leather or hemp               laces?  You can use almost anything             for lacing huaraches.            In my testing, though, I found some issues with hemp and leather             that I didnג€™t like:                         Both leather and hemp tended to stretch, especially when moist              Both leather and hemp tighten and stiffen when they dry              Both leather and hemp wear out faster than our polyester laces              Leather is much more expensive              Most leather laces are rectangular, and the edges can dig into               your skin              Leather, isnג€™t vegan (for those who care about that)              Leather and hemp donג€™t give you as many fun color choices                       The 100% polyester cord we use is strong, light, and doesnג€™t             stretch or tighten, especially when wet.            Also, I prefer the ג€slip-onג€ method of tying which works best with             a round lace, rather than a flat one (like leather).            Needless to say, you can replace the lace we send you with whatever             you like.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

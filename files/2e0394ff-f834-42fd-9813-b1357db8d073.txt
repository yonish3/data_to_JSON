Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: HERON 

Short description:
The heron elegantly walks along the river bank. The ground beneath his claws is
frozen. In the evening, he lowers his head far beneath the white tips of his
wings so as not to freeze and dreams of gliding effortlessly through the warm
summer air.
This special high cut in grey with green diamonds keeps little wild paws warm
and safe through cold days. The 100% virgin wool uppers from certified organic
sources along with the high-quality, temperature- and moisture-regulating felted
wool from Nordwolle ensure a pleasantly cosy warmth. The integrated membrane
also protects the feet during wild adventures and the flexible sole makes sure
nothing stands in the way.
microfibre padding on the heel offers additional comfort and protection for the
inner lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first
wearing.
The matching Tencel®-coated elastic laces can be swapped for different colored
cotton or elastic laces as the mood takes you.
Please note:
The large checked pattern results in different cuts.
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Short description:
Off-road adventure awaits. The original fit and feel of the Minimus Trail 10 is
back. With an upper made of flexible synthetic/mesh materials and a Vibram®
outsole with flex grooves, this men's trail running shoe offers the traction and
durability you need to run on rocky trails. A midfoot wrap helps your foot stay
in place, while premium performance foam provides lightweight support.
This style runs small. We suggest ordering a 1/2 size up.
The Minimus Trail 10 for men is a trail running favorite with a natural feel
that's durable and protective.

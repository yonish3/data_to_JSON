Model name: SILICONE SEPARATORS CORRECTING TOES MAGICAL SEPARATORS 

Short description:
Magical Separators help you stretch, strengthen and spread your toes properly.
People often do not realize that the health of feet is extremely important for
our whole body. Their deformities can contribute to problems with hips, knees or
back. Our separators will help you to evenly distribute foot pressure, which
improves our overall posture. The main task of the separators is to correct the
position of the toes, which were most often deformed by walking in hard,
improper footwear, in which our foot was compressed.
Made of soft and flexible medical silicone, they adapt to any type of adult
foot.
They are safe for our skin.
Regular use of the separators will help you return your toes to their natural
position and avoid painful surgery.
They can, and even should, be used prophylactically when we notice the initial
stages of deformation. They help in getting rid of such foot deformities as
halux, hammer-toed or clawed toes.
Our Magical barefoot shoes are created to ensure the health of our customers. We
try to make our footwear functional and not restrict the natural movement of the
foot. Magical Shoes are designed in such a way as to provide the foot with the
right amount of space in the toes, which is why they are compatible with our
separators.
Durable, medical gel used for their production, will allow you to use it for a
long time. After use, we recommend that you clean the separators in warm water
using soap. They should also be dried in a room temperature. If necessary, use
talcum powder or baby sprinkles when applying them to your toes.

(click here)    Brujita means ''Little Witch'' in Spanish. Rooted     refers to the traditional leather laces and tying method. Slip-On refers     to the style of wear with lace going over top of foot, not around the ankle,     making it much easier on-and-off at the expense of a bit more     security. These are undeniably good-looking, traditionally     styled sandals. The least amount that works the best. Perfect for     campus life, travel life, the good life.       Rooted Brujitas are like all other LUNA Roots and Rooted sandals,     i.e., they take a little skill to master wearing them;     however, it is a surprisingly easy skill to master and it gives you so much     more control over the comfort of the sandal on ''your'' foot. If you     follow the ''How To Tie LUNA Roots Sandals'', you will     soon master it for yourself.

Put on your Prio and Live Life Feet First!           a What do I do with those straps on               the Prio?  Iג€™ll admit, this is one of my             favorite things about the Prio.            The huarache-sandal inspired heel strap can be used to hold your             heel and ankle in place. Pull the straps through the ankle holes in             the sole, and then lock them in place with the laces.            The instep straps can be used to secure your instep, which can free             up your toes and forefoot to relax and function better. Use the             laces to tighten or loosen them to your liking.           a Is the Prio Waterproof?  Itג€™s             not. But the breathable mesh upper should help it dry quickly if you             get them wet.           a Whatג€™s different between the Prio,               HFS, and Speed Force?  The Prio is our best-selling             ג€do almost anythingג€ shoe ג€” running, hiking, working out, you name             it.            The Speed Force is our lightest, ג€most barefootג€ shoe.            HFS is lighter than the Prio, more rugged than the Speed Force.            The HFSג€™s sole has a new tire tread-inspired sole thatג€™s made to             handle roads and have extra traction.            The huarache-inspired midfoot and instep straps are ג€hidingג€ behind             a protective welded material.             And the lining using ג€37.5ג€ material, which is designed for extra             moisture wicking.           Load More   a How do I find my Prio Size?  Shoe             sizing, especially online, is not a perfect process. Thatג€™s why we             have a free exchange               policy.            For EU/UK/JP sizing, thereג€™s a conversion chart at the bottom of             the Prio product description.            The Prio runs a bit small. We recommend going up 1/2 size from your             usual athletic shoe size.            Also, the Prio is wider than conventional running shoes.            Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of             our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the             Prio, so use the measuring info if you can.            Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional,             any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock             deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers             model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might             be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another.            If your foot is really narrow and smaller than a menג€™s 10, you may             want to check out the ג€womenג€™sג€ Prio. The conversion between menג€™s             and womenג€™s is 1.5, so a menג€™s 8 is the same as a womenג€™s 9.5.           a Whatג€™s different between the Prio,               HFS, and Speed Force?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

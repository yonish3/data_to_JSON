Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: DOVE 

Short description:
This dove-blue minimal shoe is a classic low-cut model. The upper material scores
with its chessboard-effect Panama weave. This is, just like the inner lining,
breathable and comfortable to wear as weâ€™ve come to expect from our wild shoes.
Both lining and upper are made of high quality organic cotton. Soft microfibre
dging completes the look.
With its breathable properties, our Dove is perfect for spring and summer
temperatures. With their dove-blue color, the minimal shoes look fantastic
combined with jeans or chinos, for example. As sustainability is very important
to us, the mid-brown, flexible and lightweight outsole is made of approx. 50 %
recycled rubber and cork.
If you like, you can exchange the flat cotton laces for additional laces or
elastic laces in different colors.
Please note:
Due to the environmentally-friendly print, some color may rub off on
light-colored socks.Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
The fabrics are dyed in a very gentle and environmentally-friendly manner, with
no added chemicals.
As a result, the color of the upper material may fade, and abrasion may create a
kind of denim effect with a washed-out look.

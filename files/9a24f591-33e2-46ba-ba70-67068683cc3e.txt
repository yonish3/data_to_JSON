WORLD'S MOST PACK-ABLE BOOT

Finding boots that are ultra-minimalist, featuring a wide toebox,
    lightweight form, and zero-drop design is more difficult than locating the
    infamous Sasquatch…but why?  Where is the minimalist boot that is
    the natural shape of the human foot; a boot that brings your feet closer to
    the earth with a barefoot design; a boot so lightweight that it cuts
    down on ounces more than this week's fad diet; and a boot that has
    a wide toebox with more open space than the state of Kansas? Well,
    guess what, Dorothy? Welcome home!

We here at Lems Shoes believe that you don't need to be some
    environmentalist who survives on organic granola and berries to know that
    going natural can have its benefits, which is why we bring you the Boulder
    Boot - a barefoot boot that has all of the natural features you’ve been
    searching for all while promoting healthy foot development, better balance,
    increased mobility in the feet, legs, and back AND helps to alleviate
    certain foot ailments such as bunions and hammer toes. If you're ready for a
    9.9oz boot (size 43) that can pack down into the smallest of daypacks or
    carry you on the farthest of Sasquatch searches, then it’s time you rock the
    Boulder.

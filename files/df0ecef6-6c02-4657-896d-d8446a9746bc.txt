Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI KESHI 

Short description:
Are you ready for a shoe that’s as light as a feather and as natural as a second
skin? The first ankle-high Tanuki Keshi (“poppy”) in proud deep red is ready and
waiting to take you through the wild world.
The unrivalled, supple stretch Washi from the Japanese company Itoitex protects
your feet and lets them breathe, while you feel the elements right up close. In
this shoe you can go through rivers and forests or along beaches, but it will
also look good in the urban jungles of this world.
The insole and the microfibre padding at the heel provide your feet with even
more comfort, while protecting the shoe from abrasion at the same time. We
recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first wearing.
You can swap the dark red cotton laces for other colors or colored elastic laces
to make the look your own.
Please note:
The color of the microfibre padding can rub off. We therefore recommend washing
the shoes by hand in clear water before wearing them for the first time, and not
wearing them with light-colored socks.
Due to the environmentally-friendly print on the insole, colors may rub off. We
therefore recommend bearing that in mind when choosing which socks to wear.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item. You may therefore find
slight irregularities in texture and color.
Extensive wearing may create a kind of denim effect with a washed-out look.
This minimal shoe is water-permeable, can be worn in water and dries very
quickly.

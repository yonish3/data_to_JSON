Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ADDER 

Short description:
On a flat stone in the middle of a bare, rocky landscape, there likes a little
snake, warming its scales in the last rays of the sun. Soon the adder will
withdraw to its winter quarters to rest, dreaming of the wild adventures it’ll
embark on once it comes out of hibernation. Who knows what life will have in
store for it then?
This limited-edition minimal shoe has a very special upper material that’s also
used for outdoor clothing. It’s the perfect companion for the wildest
adventures.
The blue-grey cotton fabric from certified organic sources has a slightly raised
chequered texture and is treated with a biodegradable wax mixture that makes the
surface resistant to dirt, wind and water. The fabric feels dry.
With wonderfully warming boiled wool from Nordwolle and an integrated membrane,
the Adder protects your feet in damp autumn and cold winter weather.
You can switch the Bordeaux-colored laces for any of our other cotton or elastic
laces, available separately.
Please note:
After heavy use you can retreat the shoes with oilskin wax.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

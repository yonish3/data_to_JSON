Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ROSE RED 

Short description:
Rose Red strolls around, joyful and free. She has plenty of time to discover all
the wonders of nature: the glowing autumn leaves, fat chestnuts, delicate pussy
willow, moss-scented air. Surefooted, she enters the wood, her blazing red color
lighting the way far into its depths. But what was that? A rustling in the
undergrowth! She approaches softly. Protected by ancient branches and dense
undergrowth, a tiny hedgehog turns in its sleep. Rose Red gurgles with delight,
having seen a treasure that sheâ€™ll carry home in her heart.
This red hig cut dances and dashes with you through wild adventures. Rose Red is
a year-round model that will win your heart with its color.
On all their tours of discovery, your feet will stay protected thanks to the
integrated membrane. With an additional insole and warm socks, Rose Red will
carry you into wild adventures even on the colder days of the year.
The microfibre padding at the heel will provide extra protection for your feet.
We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first wearing.
To give your Rose Reds even more individual flair, you can switch the
Bordeaux-colored cotton laces for different elastic or cotton laces, available
separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

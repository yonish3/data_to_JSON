Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FLORA 

Short description:
In front of your feet the leaves’ shadows chase each other in an endless game.
Your ears are filled with the rustling of the trees. Your eyes feast on the
green tones. You smell the coolness of the forest, which seems always to remain
immune to the summer heat. You feel the ground under your feet. It's so close,
gently welcoming your steps.
Foot in, zip up and off you go! This minimal shoe is the perfect companion for
little Wildlings who can’t wait to get out of the house. An indigo-blue leaf
pattern on sage-green cotton decorates your feet beautifully and gives this
high-cut shoe a very special look. The integrated insole made of hemp-flax
fleece and covered with organic cotton regulates the temperature and climate in
the shoe, helping your feet keep their cool.
The microfibre padding gives your heel added comfort while protecting the lining
from wear and tear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
You can swap the petrol-colored cotton laces for other colors or colored elastic
laces to suit your mood.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of natural materials.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

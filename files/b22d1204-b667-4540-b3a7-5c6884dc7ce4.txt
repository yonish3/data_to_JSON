The Z-Trail gives you an unparalleled combination of:     Protection    Comfort    Light Weight    Flexibility    Durability    Versatility    Affordability  What can you do in your Z-Trail sandals? Practically anything!    At the end of a day of hiking, pull off your heavy, stiff boots and slip     into the freedom, comfort, and flexibility of the Z-Trailג€¦ theyג€™re so light     youג€™ll barely notice them on your feet (and will barely tell they were in     your bag).    Enjoy a run on trails or roads.    Yoga class? The grippy soles make the Z-Trail like having a yoga mat on     your feet all the time. Do your own class anywhere you are.    Head downstreamג€¦ whether youג€™re in a canoe, a kayak, or a raft, the     Z-Trail holds comfortably on your feet, and they float.    Take a walk anywhere you like, from a mountain trail to an urban jungle.     The comfort of the Z-Trail will surprise you.  What makes the Z-Trail special is the 3-layer FeelLiteג„¢ sole.     The bottom has our FeelTrueֲ® rubber for great     grip and abrasion resistance.    The middle layer of TrailFoamג„¢ provides an     incredible amount of force absorption and protection.    Then, the top BareFoamג„¢ layer adds a perfect     amount of comfort.    And the FeelLiteג„¢ sole still maintains enough     flexibility to allow for natural movement and ground-feel.  Whatג€™s the difference between the Z-Trek and Z-Trail?  Thatג€™s the Z-Trek on the left, and the Z-Trail on the right. You can see that   the Z-Trail is crazy flexible, but not quite as much as the   Z-Trek. I like to think that the Z-Trail is about protection and comfort first, and   the Z-Trek is about connection first. If Iג€™ve been wearing my Z-Trails around for a while, enjoying the comfort,   when I then put on the Z-Trek, I think, ג€Oh, right, I can FEEL things again!ג€   So I go back and forth between them, depending on how much I want to feel. Letג€™s talk about weight! This is maybe the best part.  The Z-Trail is about 20% lighter than the Z-Trek. But thatג€™s nothing. Letג€™s   compare the Z-Trail to a traditional sport sandal: The reviews for the Z-Trail have been AMAZING. Pretty much everyone says that theyג€™re the best sandal theyג€™ve worn. Check out these reviews (and then click the REVIEWS tab, above to see more!):            More reasons youג€™ll love your Z-Trail sandals:     Super-comfortable tubular webbing with no hard edges.    Adjustable Z-pattern allows you to get the right tension you desire across     the top of your foot, over your foot, and behind your heel.    Three color combinations.    10mm (~3/8ג€³) FeelLiteג„¢ outsole protects you from unpleasant surfaces while     still providing great ground-feel.    Elegant contour surrounds your foot.    Super lightweight ג€” a womenג€™s size 7 sandal averages 4.3 ounces each.    Zero-drop means your heel isnג€™t elevated.    Rust-proof nylon hardware.    Heel cup keeps your heel in place and helps keep out debris.    Vegan-friendly.    5,000-mile sole warranty! Wear out your Z-Trail soles in under 5,000 miles     and weג€™ll replace them for a nominal cost (details here).      a What can I do in the Z-Trail?  Practically             anything. Take a walk on the beach, a hike in the woods, hang out             with friend, stroll around the campsite, approach a climb, paddle a             canoe or a raft, do yoga or Crossfit, run a marathonג€¦            Iג€™m not sure that Z-Trail, or any sandal for that matter, is right             for lateral motion sports, like tennis or basketball.            So, use your common sense and HAVE FUN!           a How do I get the right size for my               Z-Trail?  Use the templates that are             linked on this page (next to where you select the size, and in the             product description).            NOTE: Please measure your foot and/or use the templates.             Sandal size is very often different than shoe size.            Also, if you have the Z-Trek, you may need a             different size in the Z-Trail. The Z-Trek is a TINY bit longer than             the Z-Trail, so if your toes come close to the edge in your Z-Treks,             you may want to up one size for the Z-Trail.           a Whatג€™s the difference between the               Menג€™s and Womenג€™s Z-Trail?  The womenג€™s Z-Trail is a bit             narrower, and the webbing is 4mm thinner.            So if you have a narrow foot, whether youג€™re a man or woman, you             may want to check the ג€womenג€™sג€ sizing templates and see             how those work for you. Similarly, if you have a wider foot,             regardless of your gender, check out the ג€menג€™sג€ templates.           a How do I adjust the fit in Z-Trails?  Simple.             First, slide the webbing through the slots on the outside of the             sole to get the tension you like across your toes.             Note: A lot of our customers report that they like the toe strap             looser than they thought they would. Experiment and see what you             like best.            Next, just pull the end of the webbing ג€” our proprietary tensioner             will hold everything in place. If something feels too tight, just             flip the top of the tensioner up, and the webbing will easily             loosen.            Finally, experiment with the tension of the heel strap. If you make             it tighter, itג€™ll move your foot forward a bit. Make it looser and             itג€™ll let your foot slide back.            Once you find the right tension, you have the choice to get in and             out of your Z-Trail by either un-doing the heel strap, or loosening             the top webbing. Personally, I leave the heel strap in place and use             the top webbing to get in and out.           a How do I care for the Z-Trails?  You             can wash them with soap and water.            One thing to be careful of: Do not leave your             Z-Trail in a hot car or exposed to extreme heat and sunlight (i.e.             the back window or dashboard of a car is the WORST). The TrailFoamג„¢             layer will deform if you do this, and this is not covered by our warranty.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?

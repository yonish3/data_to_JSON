Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TANUKI NIJI 

Short description:
With the Tanuki Niji you can nail your colors to the mast and still stride
elegantly through the summer. The natural white Tanuki made of stretch washi has
a little highlight: the left shoe features an embroidered rainbow flag.
This minimal shoe is ultra-light and – thanks to the unique washi fabric that’s
75% paper – is a real highlight for feet. Particularly in the summer we benefit
from its anti-bacterial effects, its breathability and its ability to dry
quickly. So the Tanuki’s also great for wearing barefoot.
Depending on your mood, the cream-colored cotton laces can be switched for other
cotton or elastic laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

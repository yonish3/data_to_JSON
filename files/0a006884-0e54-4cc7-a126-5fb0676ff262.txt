Short description:
This minimal shoe is made of a robust and breathable cotton mix, of which half
consists of recycled fibres. With its integrated membrane that increases the
water-resistant properties many times over thanks to a the water-flap
construction, this grey midcut shoe accompanies you on new and familiar paths.
The flexible white outsole and the paper-thin insole, which can be removed for
ventilation, make this minimal shoe particularly supple, ensuring a high degree
of freedom of movement.
If you prefer a touch more color, you can switch the mouse-grey cotton laces for
other elastic or cotton laces, available separately.
Please note:
The insole should always be worn in the shoe as it fixes the new membrane
construction.
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

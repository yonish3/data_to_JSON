Short description:
Constructed of durable cotton canvas for breathability, and recycled rubber

Long description:
KA-NI
Take a look at the Ka-Ni from FUGU.
Constructed from breathable cotton canvas with a recycled hard rubber slip
resistant sole, these Japanese shoes are nice to wear and nice to look at. Don’t
let their light weight fool you, these lace-less vegan shoes are fierce, perfect
for any terrain and can take whatever you’re dishing out.

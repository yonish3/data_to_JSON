Short description:
With this denim-blue high cut you can enjoy the barefoot feeling to the full,
even in winter.
The temperature-regulating and climate-regulating properties of the felted wool
from Nordwolle, a regional producer here in Germany with a particular emphasis
on sustainability, keep your feet comfortably warm. The integrated membrane
provides your feet with additional protection.
The microfibre padding gives your heel added comfort while protecting the lining
from wear and tear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
You can swap the light-grey cotton laces for laces in your choice of color.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
The fabrics are dyed in a very gentle and environmentally-friendly manner, with
no added chemicals. As a result, the color of the upper material may fade, and
abrasion may create a kind of denim effect.

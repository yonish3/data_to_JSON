Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: AMAROK 

Short description:
The Amarok confidently slips through the hoarfrost-covered undergrowth. No one
can touch him. As he makes his way to his lair, wild creatures lurk in the
darkness, but they fall back as the valiant wolf passes by. His pack already
waits for him in the warm cave.
This simple high cut combines wool with wool to create warm paws. Made of 100%
pure new wool from certified organic livestock, the anthracite-grey outer fabric
with a herringbone pattern and untreated felted wool lining from Nordwolle have
natural moisture-regulating and water-repellent properties. An integrated
membrane offers additional protection for long trips on cold days.
A microfibre padding on the heel protects the feet of your little Wildlings as
well as the inner lining. We recommend kneading it until soft before wearing for
the first time.
For more variety, you can switch the aubergine-coloured Tencel®-coated elastic
laces for different coloured cotton or elastic laces.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique handcrafted piece made of a natural fabric.
Texture and colour may show slight irregularities.

Long description:
Caballo Blanco (beige litter)
Fascinated by McDougall’s book “Born to Run” we’ve created running sandals which
are based on those used for running by Indians of the Tarahumara tribe.
Their name comes from the remarkable runner Micah True who in the book was
called precisely Caballo Blanco.

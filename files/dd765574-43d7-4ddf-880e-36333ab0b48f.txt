Model name: BUZZARD 

Short description:
Our long-term partner Nordwolle has something very special for the striking
plumage of this mid cut: the herringbone pattern has been created by using the
wool of two different breeds of sheep so that it does not require any dyeing.
Combined with a lining of natural, temperature- and moisture-regulating felted
wool from Nordwolle and the integrated membrane, it keeps your feet warm
throughout the winter.
The microfibre padding on the heel offers additional comfort and protection for
the inner lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
The dark brown linen laces can be switched for different colored cotton or
elastic laces as the fancy takes you.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

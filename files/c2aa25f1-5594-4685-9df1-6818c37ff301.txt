Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: PEACOCK 

Short description:
Easy and free, it struts through the wild garden. It can be spotted from afar:
blue gown shining brightly, feathers shimmering in the light. It senses that all
eyes are upon it and it shows what it can do. How high it jumps, how far it
walks, how loud and clear it calls. Itâ€™s not vain; it just wants everyone to
enjoy its splendour.
The petrol-colored, abrasion-resistant canvas upper of the Peacock brings you
color, even on dull, grey days.
The integrated membrane protects your feet, while the cosy plush lining keeps
them warm.
Additional comfort is provided by the microfibre padding at the heel, which also
protects the lining from wear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it
before the first wearing.
Vanilla-toned elastic laces add an element of contrast to the colorful minimal
shoe. If you prefer a different color combination, you can swap the elastic
laces for different colors or for cotton laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
The fabrics are dyed in a very gentle and environmentally-friendly manner, with
no added chemicals. As a result, the color of the upper material may fade, and
abrasion may create a kind of denim effect.

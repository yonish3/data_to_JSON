Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: DayLite Hiker EV ג€“ Women   Short description: Your favorite boot for your favorite trails and journeys   Long description: Product Description  Most hikes donג€™t need a big, heavy, technical hiking boot. And most hiking boots donג€™t let your foot bend, move, flex and feel the   worldג€¦ until the DayLite Hiker EV ג€EVג€ is short for ג€EVolutionג€ because this version of the DayLite Hiker is a   new and improved version of the original. Plus itג€™s designed to let your foot   move and function the way itג€™s supposed to. Perfect for day hikes and casual wear, the DayLite Hiker EV is built with our   foot-first design and natural movement philosophy.    Natural FIT ג€“ Wide,     anatomically correct toe boxes let your toes spread and relax, plus a     non-elevated, ג€zero-dropג€ heel for proper posture.

The low-to-the-ground design is perfect for     balance and agility.    Natural FEEL ג€“ Your     feet are supposed to FEEL the world. Our patented FeelTrueֲ® soles give you     just-right protection while also giving you the ground feedback that your     brain and body want.

We             know from experience that whatever we say here, people will ignore             and theyג€™ll do whatever they want in their DayLite Hiker.            After all, we know of people who run marathons in their Hana and             Lena, and those are described as ג€casualג€ shoes. נ˜‰            We designed the DayLite Hiker for the kind of journeys that most             people take, most of the time ג€” day hikes, non-technical trails, and             even just walking around. While itג€™s not a ג€technicalג€ hiker, the             flexible FeelTrueֲ® sole will let it tackle more than just a stroll.

Like             all our shoes, the DayLite Hiker has a ג€huarache-inspiredג€ heel             strap. You can tighten or loosen that to give a bit more (or less)             support around your heel, which can hold your foot in place better.            And like the Prio, the DayLite Hiker has independently adjustable             instep straps. You can tighten the laces going through those             ג€inverted Vג€ straps to cinch the boot around your instep. This can             also help keep your foot secure. Securing your instep (but not TOO             much) can actually let your toes relax even moreג€¦ experiment with             the tension of these straps and see what you experience.           a Whatג€™s different between the Menג€™s               and Womenג€™s DayLite Hiker?  We use ג€menג€™sג€ and ג€womenג€™sג€             as a matter of convention. We know there are some men who will fit             better in the ג€womenג€™sג€ shoe, and vice versa.            The ג€menג€™sג€ style is a bit wider across the toes and in the heel.             The womenג€™s, conversely, has a narrower heel and slightly less-wide             toe box.            If youג€™re a man with a very thin foot, or a women with a wide foot,             you may want to try the ג€otherג€ style.           a How do I find my DayLite Hiker Size?  Sizing,             as youג€™ve probably experienced, is different between brands. You may             wear a 9 from one company and then anything between an 8 and 10 from             another company.            Luckily, if the size you get is incorrect, we do have a free exchange policy.            The Daylite Hiker runs small. We recommend choosing 1 full size             larger than your usual size.            If you already have a pair of Prio, the DayLite Hiker fits             similarly. If you have the Hana or Lena, youג€™ll probably want to go             up 1/2 a size because of the difference in performance vs. casual             shoes.            If you plan to wear thick socks with the DayLite Hiker, you may             want to add 1/2 a size to accommodate that.             We have sizing guidelines on this page and our main sizing page but keep in mind that these             are ג€guidelines.ג€ People like their shoes to fit differently ג€” some             like their toes right up at the edge, others like to have 1/4ג€³-1/2ג€³             of extra space in front of their toes.            Using the guidelines we give, again, if youג€™re really close to the             next 1/2 size up, weג€™d recommend starting with that.            Did I mention our exchange policy? נ˜‰           a Is the DayLite Hiker Waterproof?  Itג€™s             not waterproof because the tongue is independent of the rest of the             upper, though the ballistic mesh material in the upper definitely             makes this boot a little more rain-friendly than most other             footwear.

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?  After             you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email             address for the recipient.            You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

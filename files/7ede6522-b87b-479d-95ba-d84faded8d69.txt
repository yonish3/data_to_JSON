Manufacturer: XeroShoes  Model name: Hana - Casual Canvas Shoe for Women   Short description: Lightweight casual comfort thatג€™s ready for your next adventure.   Long description: Product Description Get the comfort and freedom of our best-selling sandals with an     elegant closed-toe style and casual canvas comfort  For years, people have told us, ג€We LOVE our sandals, but what do we do when itג€™s cold out, or when I need something with closed-toes for work, or if I need a bit more protection?ג€ The Hana is the answer. The menג€™s Hana was our first closed-toe shoe. Weג€™re thrilled to now have the   womenג€™s version. The Hana is, first and foremost, a casual shoe.  But since itג€™s built on   our high-performance FeelTrueֲ® sandal base, itג€™ll handle much more.    Why youג€™ll love the Hana    Natural FIT ג€” a wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the     ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for proper posture,     balance, and agility.    Natural FUNCTION ג€” the Hana is flexible enough to let your feet bend,     move, and flex the way, well, that feet are supposed     to. Plus, theyג€™re so lightweight, youג€™ll barely know you have them on. A     womanג€™s 7 is only 6.5 ounces each.    Natural FEEL ג€” the Hana has a 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole, so you get     great protection while still getting the ground feedback that your feet     like. With an optional 2mm insole we include, the Hana truly lets you Feel     The Worldֲ®.    Vegan-friendly materials ג€” the Hanaג€™s upper is canvas, the lining is     moisture wicking and super smooth, and the external accents are microfiber.     It washes easily with soap and water.    Huarache-inspired design ג€” the heel/instep strap is not only eye-catching     but functional.    Flexible heel ג€” feel free to step on the heel and wear the Hana as a slide  Plus, Hana now has a new, ג€Rain-Friendlyג€ upper. BTW, ג€Rain-Friendlyג€ isnג€™t the same as ג€waterproof.ג€ Fully water-proof shoes   have a technical liner, sealed seams, and a much higher   price. By pre-treated the Hana with a water-resistant coating, you get an   extra layer of protection against light splashing right out of the box. As with all treatments of this type, it will wear off over time, so we   recommend re-treating as you would other water sensitive footwear regularly   depending on use.   a How do I find my Womenג€™s Hana size?  The             Womenג€™s Hana used to run about a half-size small.            However, we resized them as of September 4th, 2019 so that they are             now regarded as true-to-size. We now recommend that you go with your             ג€usualג€ shoe size.            If our sizing recommendation isnג€™t correct, we do have an exchange policy.           a Is the Hana Waterproof?  The             Hana isnג€™t fully waterproof but our newest Hana is ג€water resistantג€             so your feet should stay dry in most weather conditions.           a What can I do in my Hanas?  Practically             anything. Though the Hana is designed as a casual shoe, itג€™s             certainly capable of much more than just hanging out.            Weג€™ve had people do all kinds of outrageous activities in them so             far, but itג€™s up to your best judgment what you believe they can             handle.            So, use your common sense and have fun!           a How do I care for my Hanas?  You             will be able to wash them with a mild soap and water mixture. The             canvas is quite durable, and should come clean easily with a little             scrubbing.            DO NOT place your Hanaג€™s in the dryer when you are finished             cleaning, let them air dry.           a How do I find my Hana size?  Shoe             sizing, especially online, is not a perfect process. Thatג€™s why we             have a free exchange             policy.            The Menג€™s Hana used to run about a half-size small.            However, we resized them as of August 13th, 2019 so that they are             now regarded as true-to-size. We now recommend that you go with your             ג€usualג€ shoe size.            Also, the Hana is wider than conventional shoes. The canvas upper             can stretch to become a bit wider.             Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional,             any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock             deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers             model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might             be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another.             Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of             our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the             Hana.

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).             Also, check our Stores page. There may be a             Xero Shoes dealer closer to you.           a How do I send a gift certificate?

You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if             you like.            You can also take the Gift Certificate code and send it to the             recipient.

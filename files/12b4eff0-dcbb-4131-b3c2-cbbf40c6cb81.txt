Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: ADDER 

Short description:
The upper of this limited-edition mid-cut shoe is made of fabric that's also used
for outdoor clothing.
The blue-grey cotton from certified organic sources has an attractive ripstop
look and is treated with a biodegradable wax mixture.
The wax layer makes the Adder resistant to dirt, wind and water while
maintaining the breathability of the cotton.
With cosy boiled wool to regulate moisture and foot climate, plus an integrated
membrane, this minimal shoe is the perfect companion on mild days as well as in
the cold season.
The brick-colored cotton laces and the thin and flexible outsoles in the same
color complete the Adderâ€™s distinctive look. And if you want to ring the
changes, you can switch the flat laces for other cotton or elastic ones,
available separately.
Please note:
After heavy use you can retreat the shoes with oilskin wax.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Long description:
Ballerina Anna are minimalist, handmade shoes made of high quality natural grain
leather. Thanks to it the upper is soft and gives slightly to the feet. The
inside of the ballet flat is the combination of 100% cotton and natural leather.
Essentially this ensures the comfort of use and great ventilation.
Five-millimetre, flat sole Magical Rubber guarantees extreme flexibility of the
shoes and the sensation of bare feet. Sports â€“ elegant design and decorative
buckle on the ankle are an ideal combination of functionality and aesthetics.

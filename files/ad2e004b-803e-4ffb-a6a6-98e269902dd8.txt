Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: KELPIE 

Short description:
The last drops of rain fall sluggishly into the water. They are so heavy that
rather than splashing, they make a sound like a dull drumbeat echoing across the
river. The wind drives away the clouds, but the late sunlight struggles to
brighten the day again. The river lies deep blue in the valley; colorful leaves
spin across its surface in circles, bubbles of water arise here and there. They
carry the coldest part of the river water to the surface, revealing the secrets
of its depths.
With its robust canvas upper, made of denim-blue organic cotton, the Kelpie is
the perfect companion for all your adventures in the wilderness or the urban
jungle.
This high-cut minimal shoe is lined with untreated, climate-regulating and
temperature-regulating felted wool from Nordwolle and keeps your feet cosily
warm and dry in grey autumn weather and on glorious snow-filled days.
Microfibre padding at the heel makes the shoe more comfortable and protects the
felted wool from wear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
The ochre-colored elastic laces make the shoes easier to put on and allow them
to adapt perfectly to your feet. You can quickly give your Kelpie a brand new
look by choosing cotton laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.
The fabrics are dyed in a very gentle and environmentally-friendly manner, with
no added chemicals. As a result, the color of the upper material may fade, and
abrasion may create a kind of denim effect.

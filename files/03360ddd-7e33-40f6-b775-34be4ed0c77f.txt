Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: AMAROK 

Short description:
The warm high cut for the urban jungle and wild adventures has an elegant grey
herringbone pattern. Made of 100% pure new wool from certified organic
livestock, the outer fabric and untreated, temperature-controlling and
moisture-regulating Nordwolle felted wool lining and integrated membrane protect
and warm your feet.
microfibre padding on the heel offers additional comfort and protection for the
inner lining. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the first
wearing.
For more variety, you can switch the dark grey cotton laces for different
coloured cotton or elastic laces.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and colour.

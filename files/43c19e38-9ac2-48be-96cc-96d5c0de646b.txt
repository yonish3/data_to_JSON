Long description: Product Description NOTE ג€” The Lena is     on clearance because weג€™re discontinuing this style and replaced it with the     womenג€™s Hana. Click Here to see     that product. Get the fun and freedom of our best-selling sandals with     super-cute closed-toe style and casual canvas comfort  For years, people have told us, ג€We LOVE our sandals, but what do we do when   itג€™s cold out, or when I need something with closed-toes for work, or if I   need a bit more protection?ג€ The Lena is the answer for women. The Lena, like our other casual canvas shoe, the Hana, is meant to be a   casual shoe.  We donג€™t suggest that you run an ultramarathon in the Lena,   but we know when you have our high-performance FeelTrueֲ® sandal base under   your foot, some of you will do more in the Lena than just hanging out.  Check out these reviews from Lena wearers   What youג€™ll love about the Lena   Itג€™s what makes all our Xero Shoes special ג€” we believe in feet! Your feet are   supposed to bend, flex, and feel the world. The Lena lets you do that.    Natural FIT ג€” the wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the     ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for     proper posture, balance, and agility.    Natural FUNCTION ג€” the flexible Lena lets your feet bend, move, and flex     the way that feet are supposed to. Plus, theyג€™re so     light, you might forget you have them on. A womanג€™s size 7 is only 6 ounces     each.    Natural FEEL ג€” the Lena uses the 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole from our     Z-Trek sandal. That means you get protection while still letting you feel     the sensations that your feet want. If you need a bit of extra protection,     just toss in the optional 2mm insole.    Vegan-friendly materials ג€” the Lena has a canvas upper, with a cotton     lining and microfiber accents. You can wash it with soap and water.    Huarache-inspired design ג€” the heel/instep strap adds a subtle,     eye-catching call out, but itג€™s also functional, holding your heel and     cinching up around your instep.    Flexible heel ג€” you can step on the heel and wear the Lena as a slide  Is the Lena just for women?   Weג€™ve designed it as a ג€womanג€™sג€ shoe. Compared to the Hana, the shape is a   bit narrower and accommodates a slightly higher instep. The pattern offers a   bit more adjustment, too. The canvas isnג€™t as ג€outdoorsyג€ as the one in the   Hana. That said, men with a narrow foot might still like the Lena. And women   with wider feet may want to try the Hana.   a What can I do in the Lena?  Though             the Lena is designed as a casual shoe, itג€™s certainly capable of             much more than just hanging out.            Weג€™ve had people do all kinds of outrageous activities in them so             far, but itג€™s up to your best judgment what you believe they are             capable of handling.            So, use your common sense and have fun!           a How do I care for my Lenas?  You             can wash them with a mild soap and water mixture. The canvas is             quite durable, and should come clean easily with a little scrubbing.            DO NOT place your Lena in the dryer when you are finished cleaning,             let them air dry.           a Is the Lena only for Women?  While             we designed the Lena as a ג€womenג€™s shoeג€ ג€” slightly narrower than             the Hana, slightly higher instep, slightly different pattern ג€” if             youג€™re a man with a narrower foot, the Lena might be just right for             you.           a How do I find my size for the Lena?  Shoe             sizing, especially online, is not a perfect process. Thatג€™s why we             have a free exchange               policy.             We have sizing instructions at the bottom of the product description             for the Lena.            The Lena fits ג€true-to-sizeג€ or a TINY bit small. So youג€™ll             probably be okay selecting your ג€usualג€ shoe size. If you think             youג€™re ג€between sizes,ג€ go up a 1/2 size.            Also, the Lena is wider than conventional shoes. Some people have             experienced stretching in the canvas upper to slightly wider.             Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional,             any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock             deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers             model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might             be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another.            Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of             our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the             Lena.            If your foot is bigger than the Lena, check out the Hana instead.           a Why do my Lenas suddenly feel               looser?  The canvas upper of the Lena             can stretch a little bit. Most people find this more comfortable as             it happens. You should be able to adjust the lacing to feel snug             around your midfoot and let your toes be free.           a Is the Lena Waterproof?  No,             the Lena is a canvas shoe, and will absorb any water it encounters.             It is a light canvas, though, and should dry pretty fast after you             take them off. Also, you can treat the Lena with an aftermarket             waterproofing sprayג€¦ but that will make them a bit less flexible.           Load More   a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around             the world.             We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot             guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class             International.            International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks             depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border.            Please note that some countries do require the payment of import             duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise             you to know the import regulations of your country and understand             that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees             imposed by your government at the border.            All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial             shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re             giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a             gift).

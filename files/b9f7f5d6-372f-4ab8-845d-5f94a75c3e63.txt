Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FEATHER RAVEN 

Short description:
A robust and understated sandal that looks good, is elegant, light as a feather
and up for any adventure - that sums up the Feather Raven.
The upper material consists of microfibre, which makes the sandal particularly
robust.
Just like with the closed Rewild models, the flexible and minimalistic outsole
is made of a cork-rubber mix.
The insole cover is breathable and quick-drying, consisting of 75% washi and 25%
polyester. The insole of EVA* and walnut shells is completely integrated,
ensures a secure fit and impresses with its naturally antibacterial properties.
The raven-black sandal gives the foot lots of room. The closed strap over the
big toe actively supports the windlass mechanism. Thanks to the natural movement
of the big toe, the Feather Raven is magically drawn to the sole of the foot as
you walk and run.
The supple and flexible micro-velcro fastening ensures that the sandal can
easily be adjusted to fit your foot and goes along with any kind of movement.
IMPORTANT:
Please see the notes about finding your size, as the size you need for the
sandals will differ from your normal Wildling size!

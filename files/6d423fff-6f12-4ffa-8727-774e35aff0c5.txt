Put on your TerraFlex             and Live Life Feet First!           a What do I do with those Straps on               the TerraFlex?  This is one of my favorite             features in the TerraFlex.            The huarache-sandal inspired heel strap can be used to hold your             heel and ankle in place. Pull the straps through the ankle holes in             the sole, and then lock them in place with the laces.            The instep straps can be used to secure your instep, which can free             up your toes and forefoot to relax and function better. Use the             laces to tighten or loosen them to your liking.           a Whatג€™s different between TerraFlex               and Mesa Trail?  The TerraFlex is our first             shoe designed for trails. With a rugged, stitched upper, itג€™s great             for running and hiking.             The Mesa Trail is made more specifically for trail running, with a             lightweight breathable mesh upper, extra moisture wicking with the             ג€37.5ג€ lining, and a protective welded covering for the adjustable             midfoot and instep straps.            Both shoes have a grippy, lugged, dual-chevron tread, and a 3mm             TrailFoam layer (ג€hidingג€ in the outsole) for just-right protection             and comfort.

For EU/UK/JP sizing, thereג€™s a conversion chart at the bottom of             the TerraFlex               product description.            The TerraFlex now runs fairly true to size. We recommend going with             your usual athletic shoe size.            The TerraFlex is wider than conventional trail running shoes.            Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of             our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the             TerraFlex, so use the measuring info if you can.            Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional,             any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock             deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers             model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might             be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. And then, thereג€™s personal             preference: three people with identical feet might think the same             shoe fits differently.            If your foot is really narrow and smaller than a menג€™s 10, you may             want to check out the ג€womenג€™sג€ TerraFlex. The conversion between             menג€™s and womenג€™s is 1.5, so a womenג€™s 8 is the same as a menג€™s 6.5.           a Whatג€™s different between TerraFlex               and Mesa Trail?

The cost to ship             will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you             select; several options will be provided at checkout.            All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is             available for some first class international shipments depending on             the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority             Express and Express International shipments.            Though almost all of our international orders arrive without             incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express             International or Express International if you live in a country with             a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to)             India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia.

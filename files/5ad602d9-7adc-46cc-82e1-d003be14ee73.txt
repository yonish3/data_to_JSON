Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: POLA 

Short description:
The grasses look like sunrays that have been planted in the ground. Dazzling and
warm, they stretch out, their tips tickling gently as they glide through our
hands. Their wild jumble seems to have no logic, and yet on this summer meadow
everything is exactly right the way it is.
The yellow-beige Pola is perfect for summer.
Its upper is made of a cotton-linen mix and the integrated hemp-flax fleece
insole ensures a pleasant foot climate.
With an ultra-thin outsole of only 2.5 mm, walking and running become a sensory
experience.
Feet that are still growing are given optimum support and can play out their
strengths.
With the choice of laces, little wildlings can let their imaginations run free.
Elastic or cotton laces in other colors are available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

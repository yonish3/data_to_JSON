Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: TARPAN 

Short description:
The young Tarpan gallops wildly at the side of its mother across the
frost-covered ground. There is something to discover behind every bush. Its
curiosity constantly leads to new adventures. Its shaggy mane is tousled by the
wind.
Thanks to these low cuts, little Wildlings can also enjoy adventures outside of
summer. The Tarpan now even makes it possible on cold days, too.
Lined with warm and climate-regulating felted wool from Nordwolle and a sturdy
upper material made of cotton from controlled organic sources, it is the ideal
companion for every journey.
The integrated membrane and microfibre padding at the heel offer the smallest
hooves additional protection and comfort.
For even more color, you can also switch the medium blue Tencel®-covered elastic
laces for different colored cotton or elastic laces as the fancy takes you.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

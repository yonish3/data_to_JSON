Short description:
Up your training with the Minimus 20v7. The new knit upper is constructed with
nylon-infused yarn that form a barrier around the foot for superior protection
and lateral support. Monomesh windows help increase ventilation, and an
asymmetrical collar made of molded foam offers a more natural fit. The shoe also
features a one-piece Vibram® outsole to provide the reliable traction and ground
feel you need to maintain a natural stance during strength training.

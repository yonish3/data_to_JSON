Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FILLY 

Short description:
The sun’s soft light sets across the meadow; the wind blows away the last wisps
of fog. The filly cautiously attempts her first steps. She blinks curiously
towards the sun, lovingly watched over by the herd. Soon, there is no stopping
her. In high spirits, she plays around wildly. The wind and the little one
indulge in a gleeful competition. Faster and faster they charge through the
world together, not pausing to rest until twilight falls. Exhausted and happy,
the little filly snuggles in as close as possible to her family.
The Filly shoe adapts gently and steadily to little hooves. A warm layer of pure
new wool provides warmth, creating a cosy feeling of security for those first
few steps. The perfect warm, flexible and pliable minimal shoe for the tiniest
children's feet. The untreated felted wool from Nordwolle is produced regionally
in Germany with a particular emphasis on sustainability.
If the Filly is the first learn-to-walk shoe for your little one, then during
the cold season you’ll be glad of the naturally warming and climate-regulating
properties of wool. An integrated membrane offers additional protection when
romping through the colorful autumn leaves, as well as in winter.
The berry-red elastic laces, which make it easier to get into this children's
shoe, can be swapped for other elastic laces, available separately, and
shortened as required.
Please note:
Due to the small size of the shoe, the fox label is printed on this model.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item made of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

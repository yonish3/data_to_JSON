Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FEATHER GOOSE 

Short description:
The Feather Goose is a featherweight sandal that flatters your feet and takes you
anywhere from the day-to-day office routine to an exhilarating road trip
adventure.
Made from sturdy microfiber with a flexible minimal sole composed of a
rubber-cork blend, this shoe elegantly conforms to the unique shape of your
foot. The closed strap over the big toe actively supports the so-called windlass
mechanism. Through the natural movement of the big toe as you walk and run, the
sandal adheres to the foot as if by magic.
The upper of the breathable and quick-drying insole is made of washi, which
boasts natural antibacterial properties. For enhanced stability, it is securely
integrated into the sandal and cannot be removed.
The Feather Goose leaves plenty of space for your feet and, weighing in at just
100–190 g, is as light as a feather.
Flexible and supple micro-velcro adapts readily to the foot and is robust enough
to withstand all kinds of movement.
IMPORTANT:
Please follow the fitting guidelines for determining the size you need, as the
correct sandal size will differ from your normal Wildling size!

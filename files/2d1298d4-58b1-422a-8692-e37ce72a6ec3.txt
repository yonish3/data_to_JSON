Long description:
The thermal protection of the new MS Alaskan model will work perfectly even in
the coldest climate! The high weight of natural wool results in that you feel
comfortable even at minus 20Â°C.
Walking in MS Alaskan will allow your feet for a comfortable and most
importantly natural full range of motion.
High quality goat leather combined with a suede sole guard protects against
soaking. The thin and light sole (~7 mm), thanks to its tread, makes every step
steady, even on a very slippery surface.
The zipper fastening makes it easier to quickly put on the shoes without
unnecessary lacing.
A wide toe box, zero drop, high flexibility, and extraordinary lightness make MS
Alaskan the best winter shoes for everyone who wants to feel barefoot in any
conditions.

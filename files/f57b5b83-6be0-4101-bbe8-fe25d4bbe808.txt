Short description:
Up your training with the Minimus 20v7. The knit upper is constructed with
nylon-infused yarn that forms a barrier around the foot for lateral support.
Mono mesh windows help increase ventilation, and an asymmetrical collar made of
molded foam offers a more natural fit. The shoe also features a one-piece
Vibram® outsole to provide the reliable traction and ground feel you need to
maintain a natural stance during strength training.

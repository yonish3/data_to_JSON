Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: CHICK 

Short description:
They may be small and delicate, but they’ve already achieved great things. Their
desire for freedom, their curiosity and their strength have enabled them to do
something miraculous. Each chick has freed itself from its shell, and now here
it is in all its downy uniqueness.
Breathability, robustness, lightness and absolute freedom of movement – defining
characteristics of this Wildling for the littlest feet. Made of a sustainable
mix of recycled cotton and cotton from certified organic sources, the Chick
impresses with its only 1mm thick minimal sole that matches little ones’
movements as they discover the world.
For more color you can switch the mouse-grey laces made of cotton from certified
organic sources for elastic or cotton ones, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

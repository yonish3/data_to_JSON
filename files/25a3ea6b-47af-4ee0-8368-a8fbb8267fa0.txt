Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: KINGFISHER 

Short description:
Tiny air bubbles rise to the surface where just a moment ago the lake was so
smooth that you could see the sky in it. The little kingfisher gives itself a
good shake; a tiny fish is wriggling in its beak. Again and again it dives into
the water – so fast that our eyes can't keep up. Spellbound, we watch the little
creature and understand a little bit more about this world.
The Kingfisher's dazzling blue-white checked upper is particularly robust. The
cotton mix consists of nearly 50% recycled cotton and cotton from certified
organic sources with some polyester content. It’s perfect for anything little
explorers might get up to.
Combined with the integrated climate-regulating insole made of hemp-flax fleece,
the 2.5 mm flexible outsole of this minimal shoe provides for maximum comfort
and unrestricted freedom of movement.
If you want to ring the changes you can switch the neon-yellow, cotton-covered
elastic laces for other elastic or cotton laces, available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

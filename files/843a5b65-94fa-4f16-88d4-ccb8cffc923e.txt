Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: CRANE 

Short description:
The mist at the bank clears, revealing a thick wall of wings and feathers. A herd
of cranes has been resting for the night by the lake. Suddenly there's a jolt
over here, a flapping over there; a murmur goes around the group. The first
birds sprint off, spreading their wings and beating them powerfully in the
morning air. As one, the cranes fly off together in search of their next
adventure.
In combination with an integrated membrane, that increases the water-resistant
properties many times over thanks to a new water-flap construction, the Craneâ€™s
robust, breathable cotton mix provides little adventurers with special
protection wherever they go.
The flexible white outsole and the paper-thin insole, which can be removed for
ventilation, make this minimal shoe particularly supple, ensuring a high degree
of freedom of movement.
If your little wildling requires more color, he or she can switch the
cotton-covered mouse-grey elastic laces for elastic or cotton laces in other
colors, available separately.
Please note:
The insole should always be worn in the shoe as it fixes the new membrane
construction.
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

Model name: DANDELION 

Short description:
For as long as we can remember, we’ve performed a magical ritual with this
enchanted ball of fluff. We’ve picked it with the greatest care, holding our
breath while the dandelion clock nods between our fingers. After a few delicious
moments of reflection, we let out our breath; the little seeds whirl up, dancing
here and there before peacefully going on their way.
The sand-colored midcut with its understated summer print is a minimal shoe for
every day.
It’s upper is made of 100% cotton from certified organic sources and it has an
integrated insole made of hemp-flax fleece that ensures a good foot climate.
With the flexible, only 2.5 mm thin outsole, each movement can be appreciated to
the full, every step becomes an adventure.
The yellow elastic laces can be changed according to taste. Cotton or elastic
laces in other colors are available separately.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a unique, handcrafted item with an upper made of a
natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

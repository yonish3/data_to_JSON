Manufacturer: Wildling 
Model name: FLYING FOX 

Short description:
The silky-black classic for every occasion. Whether in the office, the urban
jungle or the forest, with its minimal sole this all-round talent offers you
all-round comfort.
The Flying Fox is unlined, breathable and comfortable to wear on balmy summer
days and before the real cold weather arrives.
The insole, made of hemp-flax fleece and covered with organic cotton, regulates
moisture and temperature.
With an additional insole and a pair of warm socks, this all-season shoe will
also take you through cooler days. The integrated membrane provides additional
protection.
The microfibre padding gives your heel added comfort while protecting the lining
from wear and tear. We recommend kneading the padding to soften it before the
first wearing.
Different cotton laces or elastic laces, available separately, give the flying
fox even more color and variety.
Please note:
Each individual shoe is a handmade unique specimen, its upper material consists
of a natural material.
You may therefore find slight irregularities in texture and color.

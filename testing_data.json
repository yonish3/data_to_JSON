We know from experience that whatever we say here, people will ignore and theyג€™ll do whatever they want in their DayLite Hiker. After all, we know of people who run marathons in their Hana and Lena, and those are described as ג€casualג€ shoes. נ˜‰ We designed the DayLite Hiker for the kind of journeys that most people take, most of the time ג€” day hikes, non-technical trails, and even just walking around. While itג€™s not a ג€technicalג€ hiker, the flexible FeelTrueֲ® sole will let it tackle more than just a stroll. Check out the reviews to see what others are doing in their DayLite Hikers. a What do those straps do? Like all our shoes, the DayLite Hiker has a ג€huarache-inspiredג€ heel strap. You can tighten or loosen that to give a bit more (or less) support around your heel, which can hold your foot in place better. And like the Prio, the DayLite Hiker has independently adjustable instep straps. You can tighten the laces going through those ג€inverted Vג€ straps to cinch the boot around your instep. This can also help keep your foot secure. Securing your instep (but not TOO much) can actually let your toes relax even moreג€¦ experiment with the tension of these straps and see what you experience. a Whatג€™s different between the Menג€™s and Womenג€™s DayLite Hiker? We use ג€menג€™sג€ and ג€womenג€™sג€ as a matter of convention. We know there are some men who will fit better in the ג€womenג€™sג€ shoe, and vice versa. The ג€menג€™sג€ style is a bit wider across the toes and in the heel. The womenג€™s, conversely, has a narrower heel and slightly less-wide toe box. If youג€™re a man with a very thin foot, or a women with a wide foot, you may want to try the ג€otherג€ style. a How do I find my DayLite Hiker Size? Sizing, as youג€™ve probably experienced, is different between brands. You may wear a 9 from one company and then anything between an 8 and 10 from another company. Luckily, if the size you get is incorrect, we do have a free exchange policy. The Daylite Hiker runs small. We recommend choosing 1 full size larger than your usual size. If you already have a pair of Prio, the DayLite Hiker fits similarly. If you have the Hana or Lena, youג€™ll probably want to go up 1/2 a size because of the difference in performance vs. casual shoes. If you plan to wear thick socks with the DayLite Hiker, you may want to add 1/2 a size to accommodate that. We have sizing guidelines on this page and our main sizing page but keep in mind that these are ג€guidelines.ג€ People like their shoes to fit differently ג€” some like their toes right up at the edge, others like to have 1/4ג€³-1/2ג€³ of extra space in front of their toes. Using the guidelines we give, again, if youג€™re really close to the next 1/2 size up, weג€™d recommend starting with that. Did I mention our exchange policy? נ˜‰ a Is the DayLite Hiker Waterproof? Itג€™s not waterproof because the tongue is independent of the rest of the upper, though the ballistic mesh material in the upper definitely makes this boot a little more rain-friendly than most other footwear.

Check out the reviews to see what others are doing in their DayLite Hikers. a What do those straps do? Like all our shoes, the DayLite Hiker has a ג€huarache-inspiredג€ heel strap. You can tighten or loosen that to give a bit more (or less) support around your heel, which can hold your foot in place better. And like the Prio, the DayLite Hiker has independently adjustable instep straps. You can tighten the laces going through those ג€inverted Vג€ straps to cinch the boot around your instep. This can also help keep your foot secure. Securing your instep (but not TOO much) can actually let your toes relax even moreג€¦ experiment with the tension of these straps and see what you experience. a Whatג€™s different between the Menג€™s and Womenג€™s DayLite Hiker? We use ג€menג€™sג€ and ג€womenג€™sג€ as a matter of convention. We know there are some men who will fit better in the ג€womenג€™sג€ shoe, and vice versa. The ג€menג€™sג€ style is a bit wider across the toes and in the heel. The womenג€™s, conversely, has a narrower heel and slightly less-wide toe box. If youג€™re a man with a very thin foot, or a women with a wide foot, you may want to try the ג€otherג€ style. a How do I find my DayLite Hiker Size? Sizing, as youג€™ve probably experienced, is different between brands. You may wear a 9 from one company and then anything between an 8 and 10 from another company. Luckily, if the size you get is incorrect, we do have a free exchange policy. The Daylite Hiker runs small. We recommend choosing 1 full size larger than your usual size. If you already have a pair of Prio, the DayLite Hiker fits similarly. If you have the Hana or Lena, youג€™ll probably want to go up 1/2 a size because of the difference in performance vs. casual shoes. If you plan to wear thick socks with the DayLite Hiker, you may want to add 1/2 a size to accommodate that. We have sizing guidelines on this page and our main sizing page but keep in mind that these are ג€guidelines.ג€ People like their shoes to fit differently ג€” some like their toes right up at the edge, others like to have 1/4ג€³-1/2ג€³ of extra space in front of their toes. Using the guidelines we give, again, if youג€™re really close to the next 1/2 size up, weג€™d recommend starting with that. Did I mention our exchange policy? נ˜‰ a Is the DayLite Hiker Waterproof? Itג€™s not waterproof because the tongue is independent of the rest of the upper, though the ballistic mesh material in the upper definitely makes this boot a little more rain-friendly than most other footwear.

After all, we know of people who run marathons in their Hana and Lena, and those are described as ג€casualג€ shoes. נ˜‰ We designed the DayLite Hiker for the kind of journeys that most people take, most of the time ג€” day hikes, non-technical trails, and even just walking around. While itג€™s not a ג€technicalג€ hiker, the flexible FeelTrueֲ® sole will let it tackle more than just a stroll. Check out the reviews to see what others are doing in their DayLite Hikers. a What do those straps do? Like all our shoes, the DayLite Hiker has a ג€huarache-inspiredג€ heel strap. You can tighten or loosen that to give a bit more (or less) support around your heel, which can hold your foot in place better. And like the Prio, the DayLite Hiker has independently adjustable instep straps. You can tighten the laces going through those ג€inverted Vג€ straps to cinch the boot around your instep. This can also help keep your foot secure. Securing your instep (but not TOO much) can actually let your toes relax even moreג€¦ experiment with the tension of these straps and see what you experience. a Whatג€™s different between the Menג€™s and Womenג€™s DayLite Hiker? We use ג€menג€™sג€ and ג€womenג€™sג€ as a matter of convention. We know there are some men who will fit better in the ג€womenג€™sג€ shoe, and vice versa. The ג€menג€™sג€ style is a bit wider across the toes and in the heel. The womenג€™s, conversely, has a narrower heel and slightly less-wide toe box. If youג€™re a man with a very thin foot, or a women with a wide foot, you may want to try the ג€otherג€ style. a How do I find my DayLite Hiker Size? Sizing, as youג€™ve probably experienced, is different between brands. You may wear a 9 from one company and then anything between an 8 and 10 from another company. Luckily, if the size you get is incorrect, we do have a free exchange policy. The Daylite Hiker runs small. We recommend choosing 1 full size larger than your usual size. If you already have a pair of Prio, the DayLite Hiker fits similarly. If you have the Hana or Lena, youג€™ll probably want to go up 1/2 a size because of the difference in performance vs. casual shoes. If you plan to wear thick socks with the DayLite Hiker, you may want to add 1/2 a size to accommodate that. We have sizing guidelines on this page and our main sizing page but keep in mind that these are ג€guidelines.ג€ People like their shoes to fit differently ג€” some like their toes right up at the edge, others like to have 1/4ג€³-1/2ג€³ of extra space in front of their toes.

More grip with a lugged chevron tread ג€“ (4.5mm FeelTrueֲ® sole base plus 3.5mm lugs) More durable, abrasion resistant upper mesh More durable Tough Tech toe bumper Wet/Dry friendly side ג€foxingג€ Easy on/off lacing hooks More reasons youג€™ll love the DayLite Hiker LIGHT ג€” Only 11.2 ounces (each) for a Menג€™s Size 9 Huarache-inspired heel strap to hold your foot securely Adjustable instep straps for perfect tension Thin and flexible FeelTrueֲ® sole Removable sockliner (insole) if you want a more barefoot feeling Vegan-friendly materials See what others are saying about the DayLite Hiker a What can I do in the Daylite Hiker? We know from experience that whatever we say here, people will ignore and theyג€™ll do whatever they want in their DayLite Hiker. After all, we know of people who run marathons in their Hana and Lena, and those are described as ג€casualג€ shoes. נ˜‰ We designed the DayLite Hiker for the kind of journeys that most people take, most of the time ג€” day hikes, non-technical trails, and even just walking around. While itג€™s not a ג€technicalג€ hiker, the flexible FeelTrueֲ® sole will let it tackle more than just a stroll. Check out the reviews to see what others are doing in their DayLite Hikers. a What do those straps do? Like all our shoes, the DayLite Hiker has a ג€huarache-inspiredג€ heel strap. You can tighten or loosen that to give a bit more (or less) support around your heel, which can hold your foot in place better. And like the Prio, the DayLite Hiker has independently adjustable instep straps. You can tighten the laces going through those ג€inverted Vג€ straps to cinch the boot around your instep. This can also help keep your foot secure. Securing your instep (but not TOO much) can actually let your toes relax even moreג€¦ experiment with the tension of these straps and see what you experience. a Whatג€™s different between the Menג€™s and Womenג€™s DayLite Hiker? We use ג€menג€™sג€ and ג€womenג€™sג€ as a matter of convention. We know there are some men who will fit better in the ג€womenג€™sג€ shoe, and vice versa. The ג€menג€™sג€ style is a bit wider across the toes and in the heel. The womenג€™s, conversely, has a narrower heel and slightly less-wide toe box. If youג€™re a man with a very thin foot, or a women with a wide foot, you may want to try the ג€otherג€ style. a How do I find my DayLite Hiker Size? Sizing, as youג€™ve probably experienced, is different between brands. You may wear a 9 from one company and then anything between an 8 and 10 from another company. Luckily, if the size you get is incorrect, we do have a free exchange policy. The Daylite Hiker runs small. We recommend choosing 1 full size larger than your usual size. If you already have a pair of Prio, the DayLite Hiker fits similarly. If you have the Hana or Lena, youג€™ll probably want to go up 1/2 a size because of the difference in performance vs. casual shoes. If you plan to wear thick socks with the DayLite Hiker, you may want to add 1/2 a size to accommodate that. We have sizing guidelines on this page and our main sizing page but keep in mind that these are ג€guidelines.ג€ People like their shoes to fit differently ג€” some like their toes right up at the edge, others like to have 1/4ג€³-1/2ג€³ of extra space in front of their toes. Using the guidelines we give, again, if youג€™re really close to the next 1/2 size up, weג€™d recommend starting with that. Did I mention our exchange policy? נ˜‰ a Is the DayLite Hiker Waterproof? Itג€™s not waterproof because the tongue is independent of the rest of the upper, though the ballistic mesh material in the upper definitely makes this boot a little more rain-friendly than most other footwear. If you really want to keep the water at bay, check out our Xcursion ג€” Xeroג€™s first fully waterproof boot. Load More a Whatג€™s your return policy? Please go to Xero Shoes Return Policy page to learn about our 45-day return policy. a Do you ship internationally? We do! Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around the world. We use the US Postal service to send our shipments. The cost to ship will depend on the weight of the package and the delivery speed you select; several options will be provided at checkout. All domestic shipments come with tracking. Limited tracking is available for some first class international shipments depending on the country, and full tracking is available with all Priority Express and Express International shipments. Though almost all of our international orders arrive without incident, we strongly advise you to select Priority Express International or Express International if you live in a country with a less reliable postal service, including (but not limited to) India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia. We cannot guarantee delivery of packages shipped using First Class International. International delivery can take anywhere from 3 days to 8 weeks depending on how long your order spends in customs at the border. Please note that some countries do require the payment of import duties for international shipments above a certain value. We advise you to know the import regulations of your country and understand that you will be responsible for payment of any duties and fees imposed by your government at the border. All packages will be marked as merchandise; as a commercial shipper, we are not able to mark a package as a gift (if youג€™re giving Xero Shoes as a gift, thatג€™s not the same as us sending a gift). Also, check our Stores page. There may be a Xero Shoes dealer closer to you. a How do I send a gift certificate? After you purchase a gift certificate, youג€™ll be able to enter an email address for the recipient. You could email it to yourself and forward it at a later time if you like.

A ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandal for travel, walking, hiking, yoga, working out, paddling, even running ultra marathons. Do everything. Go everywhere. Naturally. Long description: Product Description The simplest, most versatile sandal your feet will ever love. Weג€™ll let Xero Shoes expert, Randy Kreill, tell you about the Genesis: Itג€™s called the Genesis because it was inspired by our first product, our DIY sandal kit, and one of mankindג€™s first footwear designs. Then, of course, we updated it with the experience weג€™ve had and feedback weג€™ve gotten, from making barefoot-friendly sandals since 2009. Start enjoying your Xero Shoes Genesis just moments after they arrive in your mailbox. Why youג€™ll love the Genesis: The right combination of barefoot-friendly ground feel plus protection, thanks to our exclusive 5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber outsoles Elegant contour to hold your foot, but without unnecessary support Lightweight ג€“ Womenג€™s 7 is only 4 ounces each Pre-laced ג€” just slide in your foot and go Patent-pending tension adjustment system ג€” find the perfect fit in seconds, and then you can slide your Xeros on and off in a flash Super soft toe loop ג€” since the huaraches-inspired lacing goes around your entire foot, you donג€™t feel the toe loop the way you do in many flip-flops or other thong sandals Nylon Achilles strap with Silicone grip ג€” holds on securely and comfortably Elevated ankle holes ג€” the lace never touches the ground, and so it wonג€™t abrade Trim to fit ג€” with just kitchen scissors, you can trim the Genesis to match your foot shape Vegan-friendly 5,000-mile sole warranty! (Details here). a Can I change the laces in the Genesis? We donג€™t currently have a way to let you select different laces when you order, but if youג€™re adventurous, you can buy extra laces and swap them out with the ones that come with your Genesis (itג€™s pretty simple to do). a Whatג€™s the difference between the Genesis, Cloud, and your DIY kits? The Genesis and Cloud are ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandals. For our kits you, well, have to make them נ˜‰ Both products use our exclusive FeelTrueֲ® rubber, the only outsole product made specifically for barefoot style sandals. The Genesisג€™s sole is 5mm thick, compared to either 4mm or 6mm on the DIY kits. The Cloud has 3mm of Barefoamג„¢ in the forefoot for a bit of extra comfort and lighter weight (the Clouds float!) The Cloud and Genesis have a toe loop, so thereג€™s no knot under your foot. The Cloud and Genesis have a simpler lacing system with a patented adjustment technology that lets you get a perfect fit in just seconds. The ankle holes on the Cloud and Genesis are raised off the ground so the lace canג€™t abrade. Load More a Why donג€™t you use leather or hemp laces? You can use almost anything for lacing huaraches. In my testing, though, I found some issues with hemp and leather that I didnג€™t like: Both leather and hemp tended to stretch, especially when moist Both leather and hemp tighten and stiffen when they dry Both leather and hemp wear out faster than our polyester laces Leather is much more expensive Most leather laces are rectangular, and the edges can dig into your skin Leather, isnג€™t vegan (for those who care about that) Leather and hemp donג€™t give you as many fun color choices The 100% polyester cord we use is strong, light, and doesnג€™t stretch or tighten, especially when wet. Also, I prefer the ג€slip-onג€ method of tying which works best with a round lace, rather than a flat one (like leather). Needless to say, you can replace the lace we send you with whatever you like. Load More a Whatג€™s your return policy?

A ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandal for travel, walking, hiking, yoga, working out, paddling, even running ultra marathons. Do everything. Go everywhere. Naturally. Long description: Product Description The simplest, most versatile sandal your feet will ever love. Weג€™ll let Xero Shoes expert, Randy Kreill, tell you about the Genesis: Itג€™s called the Genesis because it was inspired by our first product, our DIY sandal kit, and one of mankindג€™s first footwear designs. Then, of course, we updated it with the experience weג€™ve had and feedback weג€™ve gotten, from making barefoot-friendly sandals since 2009. Start enjoying your Xero Shoes Genesis just moments after they arrive in your mailbox. Why youג€™ll love the Genesis: The right combination of barefoot-friendly ground feel plus protection, thanks to our exclusive 5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber outsoles Elegant contour to hold your foot, but without unnecessary support Lightweight ג€“ Womenג€™s 7 is only 4 ounces each Pre-laced ג€” just slide in your foot and go Patent-pending tension adjustment system ג€” find the perfect fit in seconds, and then you can slide your Xeros on and off in a flash Super soft toe loop ג€” since the huaraches-inspired lacing goes around your entire foot, you donג€™t feel the toe loop the way you do in many flip-flops or other thong sandals Nylon Achilles strap with Silicone grip ג€” holds on securely and comfortably Elevated ankle holes ג€” the lace never touches the ground, and so it wonג€™t abrade Trim to fit ג€” with just kitchen scissors, you can trim the Genesis to match your foot shape Vegan-friendly 5,000-mile sole warranty! (Details here). a Can I change the laces in the Genesis? We donג€™t currently have a way to let you select different laces when you order, but if youג€™re adventurous, you can buy extra laces and swap them out with the ones that come with your Genesis (itג€™s pretty simple to do). a Whatג€™s the difference between the Genesis, Cloud, and your DIY kits? The Genesis and Cloud are ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandals. For our kits you, well, have to make them נ˜‰ Both products use our exclusive FeelTrueֲ® rubber, the only outsole product made specifically for barefoot style sandals. The Genesisג€™s sole is 5mm thick, compared to either 4mm or 6mm on the DIY kits. The Cloud has 3mm of Barefoamג„¢ in the forefoot for a bit of extra comfort and lighter weight (the Clouds float!) The Cloud and Genesis have a toe loop, so thereג€™s no knot under your foot. The Cloud and Genesis have a simpler lacing system with a patented adjustment technology that lets you get a perfect fit in just seconds. The ankle holes on the Cloud and Genesis are raised off the ground so the lace canג€™t abrade. Load More a Why donג€™t you use leather or hemp laces? You can use almost anything for lacing huaraches. In my testing, though, I found some issues with hemp and leather that I didnג€™t like: Both leather and hemp tended to stretch, especially when moist Both leather and hemp tighten and stiffen when they dry Both leather and hemp wear out faster than our polyester laces Leather is much more expensive Most leather laces are rectangular, and the edges can dig into your skin Leather, isnג€™t vegan (for those who care about that) Leather and hemp donג€™t give you as many fun color choices The 100% polyester cord we use is strong, light, and doesnג€™t stretch or tighten, especially when wet. Also, I prefer the ג€slip-onג€ method of tying which works best with a round lace, rather than a flat one (like leather).

A ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandal for travel, walking, hiking, yoga, working out, paddling, even running ultra marathons. Do everything. Go everywhere. Naturally. Long description: Product Description The simplest, most versatile sandal your feet will ever love. Weג€™ll let Xero Shoes expert, Randy Kreill, tell you about the Genesis: Itג€™s called the Genesis because it was inspired by our first product, our DIY sandal kit, and one of mankindג€™s first footwear designs. Then, of course, we updated it with the experience weג€™ve had and feedback weג€™ve gotten, from making barefoot-friendly sandals since 2009. Start enjoying your Xero Shoes Genesis just moments after they arrive in your mailbox. Why youג€™ll love the Genesis: The right combination of barefoot-friendly ground feel plus protection, thanks to our exclusive 5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber outsoles Elegant contour to hold your foot, but without unnecessary support Lightweight ג€“ Womenג€™s 7 is only 4 ounces each Pre-laced ג€” just slide in your foot and go Patent-pending tension adjustment system ג€” find the perfect fit in seconds, and then you can slide your Xeros on and off in a flash Super soft toe loop ג€” since the huaraches-inspired lacing goes around your entire foot, you donג€™t feel the toe loop the way you do in many flip-flops or other thong sandals Nylon Achilles strap with Silicone grip ג€” holds on securely and comfortably Elevated ankle holes ג€” the lace never touches the ground, and so it wonג€™t abrade Trim to fit ג€” with just kitchen scissors, you can trim the Genesis to match your foot shape Vegan-friendly 5,000-mile sole warranty! (Details here). a Can I change the laces in the Genesis? We donג€™t currently have a way to let you select different laces when you order, but if youג€™re adventurous, you can buy extra laces and swap them out with the ones that come with your Genesis (itג€™s pretty simple to do). a Whatג€™s the difference between the Genesis, Cloud, and your DIY kits? The Genesis and Cloud are ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandals. For our kits you, well, have to make them נ˜‰ Both products use our exclusive FeelTrueֲ® rubber, the only outsole product made specifically for barefoot style sandals. The Genesisג€™s sole is 5mm thick, compared to either 4mm or 6mm on the DIY kits. The Cloud has 3mm of Barefoamג„¢ in the forefoot for a bit of extra comfort and lighter weight (the Clouds float!) The Cloud and Genesis have a toe loop, so thereג€™s no knot under your foot. The Cloud and Genesis have a simpler lacing system with a patented adjustment technology that lets you get a perfect fit in just seconds. The ankle holes on the Cloud and Genesis are raised off the ground so the lace canג€™t abrade. Load More a Why donג€™t you use leather or hemp laces? You can use almost anything for lacing huaraches. In my testing, though, I found some issues with hemp and leather that I didnג€™t like: Both leather and hemp tended to stretch, especially when moist Both leather and hemp tighten and stiffen when they dry Both leather and hemp wear out faster than our polyester laces Leather is much more expensive Most leather laces are rectangular, and the edges can dig into your skin Leather, isnג€™t vegan (for those who care about that) Leather and hemp donג€™t give you as many fun color choices The 100% polyester cord we use is strong, light, and doesnג€™t stretch or tighten, especially when wet. Also, I prefer the ג€slip-onג€ method of tying which works best with a round lace, rather than a flat one (like leather).

A ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandal for travel, walking, hiking, yoga, working out, paddling, even running ultra marathons. Do everything. Go everywhere. Naturally. Long description: Product Description The simplest, most versatile sandal your feet will ever love. Weג€™ll let Xero Shoes expert, Randy Kreill, tell you about the Genesis: Itג€™s called the Genesis because it was inspired by our first product, our DIY sandal kit, and one of mankindג€™s first footwear designs. Then, of course, we updated it with the experience weג€™ve had and feedback weג€™ve gotten, from making barefoot-friendly sandals since 2009. Start enjoying your Xero Shoes Genesis just moments after they arrive in your mailbox. Why youג€™ll love the Genesis: The right combination of barefoot-friendly ground feel plus protection, thanks to our exclusive 5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber outsoles Elegant contour to hold your foot, but without unnecessary support Lightweight ג€“ Womenג€™s 7 is only 4 ounces each Pre-laced ג€” just slide in your foot and go Patent-pending tension adjustment system ג€” find the perfect fit in seconds, and then you can slide your Xeros on and off in a flash Super soft toe loop ג€” since the huaraches-inspired lacing goes around your entire foot, you donג€™t feel the toe loop the way you do in many flip-flops or other thong sandals Nylon Achilles strap with Silicone grip ג€” holds on securely and comfortably Elevated ankle holes ג€” the lace never touches the ground, and so it wonג€™t abrade Trim to fit ג€” with just kitchen scissors, you can trim the Genesis to match your foot shape Vegan-friendly 5,000-mile sole warranty! (Details here). a Can I change the laces in the Genesis? We donג€™t currently have a way to let you select different laces when you order, but if youג€™re adventurous, you can buy extra laces and swap them out with the ones that come with your Genesis (itג€™s pretty simple to do). a Whatג€™s the difference between the Genesis, Cloud, and your DIY kits? The Genesis and Cloud are ready-to-wear barefoot-inspired sandals. For our kits you, well, have to make them נ˜‰ Both products use our exclusive FeelTrueֲ® rubber, the only outsole product made specifically for barefoot style sandals. The Genesisג€™s sole is 5mm thick, compared to either 4mm or 6mm on the DIY kits. The Cloud has 3mm of Barefoamג„¢ in the forefoot for a bit of extra comfort and lighter weight (the Clouds float!) The Cloud and Genesis have a toe loop, so thereג€™s no knot under your foot. The Cloud and Genesis have a simpler lacing system with a patented adjustment technology that lets you get a perfect fit in just seconds. The ankle holes on the Cloud and Genesis are raised off the ground so the lace canג€™t abrade. Load More a Why donג€™t you use leather or hemp laces? You can use almost anything for lacing huaraches. In my testing, though, I found some issues with hemp and leather that I didnג€™t like: Both leather and hemp tended to stretch, especially when moist Both leather and hemp tighten and stiffen when they dry Both leather and hemp wear out faster than our polyester laces Leather is much more expensive Most leather laces are rectangular, and the edges can dig into your skin Leather, isnג€™t vegan (for those who care about that) Leather and hemp donג€™t give you as many fun color choices The 100% polyester cord we use is strong, light, and doesnג€™t stretch or tighten, especially when wet.

The comic book character The Flash gets his super speed from the Speed Force. We think this shoe will do the same for you. While we made Speed Force to be a racing shoe, people are wearing it for MUCH more. Some take it on trails (watch where you put your feet given the feedback youג€™ll get from the 4.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole), and others simply wear it all day, every day, because of the sock-like comfort. Speed Force 360ֲ° Hereג€™s what youג€™ll love when you slip on your Speed Force: LIGHTWEIGHT ג€“ Menג€™s 9 is only 5.8 ounces GRIPPY ג€“ The tread pattern in the FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole feels super sure-footed ג€BARE-LY THEREג€ ג€“ the mesh upper with its silky smooth lining gives you a real barefoot-feeling The other reasons youג€™ll love the Speed Force are thanks to its Xero Shoes DNA: A wide toe box ג€” lets your toes spread, splay and move naturally Low-to-the-ground design for balance and agility Non-elevated, ג€zero-dropג€ heel for proper posture The flexible sole lets your feet bend and move the way theyג€™re supposed to, naturally Removable 2mm insole lets you choose the amount of barefoot feel you want 100% vegan-friendly ג€” no animal products are used in the Speed Force 5,000 mile sole warranty Get your Speed Force - Men now and Live Life Feet First! Check out some of these reviews (then click the Customer Reviews tab, above, for more): We canג€™t wait to hear about the records you break in the Speed Force, and how it helps you Live Life Feet First! a What can I do in the Speed Force? We designed the Speed Force to be a racing shoe. Our lightest, most minimalist, closest-to-barefoot shoe. What weג€™ve found, though, is people are wearing it for WAY more than that. Road running, light trail running, walking, hiking, working out, CrossFit, slackliningג€¦ itג€™s up to you. Once you get them on, Iג€™m sure youג€™ll do things we never thought of (and we want to see pictures of that!). Put on your Speed Force and Live Life Feet First! a How is Speed Force different than the Prio? The Prio is our all-around, do anything shoe. Itג€™s been our best-seller since it came out. Itג€™s got more durable upper materials and offers a bit more protection. For people who donג€™t want as much barefoot feel as the Speed Force gives, the Prio is the perfect solution.

Practically anything. The Prio is our first ג€performanceג€ shoe. Itג€™s great road running, light trail running, walking, hiking, working out, Crossfit, biking, slackliningג€¦ itג€™s obviously up to you. Once you get them on, Iג€™m sure youג€™ll do things we never thought of (and we want to see pictures of that!). Put on your Prio and Live Life Feet First! a What do I do with those straps on the Prio? Iג€™ll admit, this is one of my favorite things about the Prio. The huarache-sandal inspired heel strap can be used to hold your heel and ankle in place. Pull the straps through the ankle holes in the sole, and then lock them in place with the laces. The instep straps can be used to secure your instep, which can free up your toes and forefoot to relax and function better. Use the laces to tighten or loosen them to your liking. a Is the Prio Waterproof? Itג€™s not. But the breathable mesh upper should help it dry quickly if you get them wet. a Whatג€™s different between the Prio, HFS, and Speed Force? The Prio is our best-selling ג€do almost anythingג€ shoe ג€” running, hiking, working out, you name it. The Speed Force is our lightest, ג€most barefootג€ shoe. HFS is lighter than the Prio, more rugged than the Speed Force. The HFSג€™s sole has a new tire tread-inspired sole thatג€™s made to handle roads and have extra traction.

For EU/UK/JP sizing, thereג€™s a conversion chart at the bottom of the Prio product description. The Prio runs a bit small. We recommend going up 1/2 size from your usual athletic shoe size. Also, the Prio is wider than conventional running shoes. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Prio, so use the measuring info if you can. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. If your foot is really narrow and smaller than a menג€™s 10, you may want to check out the ג€womenג€™sג€ Prio. The conversion between menג€™s and womenג€™s is 1.5, so a menג€™s 8 is the same as a womenג€™s 9.5. a Whatג€™s different between the Prio, HFS, and Speed Force?

Long description: Product Description ג€My go-to shoes for just about everything.ג€ ג€“ Andy P. The Prio is the most comfortable shoe for everything you do. Whether youג€™re out on a run, trying out a new trail, hitting the gym, or toeing a slackline, youג€™ll love the Prioג€™s combination of freedom and protection. ג€Just-Rightג€ Protection: The Prio uses the same 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber as our Z-Trek sandal, so you get great protection while still getting the ground feedback that your feet love. The optional 2mm insole lets you have more or less of a ג€barefoot feelג€ depending on your mood. Lightweight: A menג€™s 9 is only 7.6 ounces each ג€“ youג€™ll barely notice you have them on. Secure-feeling: Our Huarache sandal-inspired reflective heel and instep straps hold your foot securely ג€“ with or without socks ג€“ while keeping your toes free to move. Plus, the Prio is made from 100% vegan-friendly materials. Imagine youג€™ve just come home after a long day at work or on the trail.

Practically anything. The Prio is our first ג€performanceג€ shoe. Itג€™s great road running, light trail running, walking, hiking, working out, Crossfit, biking, slackliningג€¦ itג€™s obviously up to you. Once you get them on, Iג€™m sure youג€™ll do things we never thought of (and we want to see pictures of that!). Put on your Prio and Live Life Feet First! a What do I do with those straps on the Prio? Iג€™ll admit, this is one of my favorite things about the Prio. The huarache-sandal inspired heel strap can be used to hold your heel and ankle in place. Pull the straps through the ankle holes in the sole, and then lock them in place with the laces. The instep straps can be used to secure your instep, which can free up your toes and forefoot to relax and function better. Use the laces to tighten or loosen them to your liking. a Is the Prio Waterproof? Itג€™s not. But the breathable mesh upper should help it dry quickly if you get them wet. a Whatג€™s different between the Prio, HFS, and Speed Force? The Prio is our best-selling ג€do almost anythingג€ shoe ג€” running, hiking, working out, you name it. The Speed Force is our lightest, ג€most barefootג€ shoe. HFS is lighter than the Prio, more rugged than the Speed Force. The HFSג€™s sole has a new tire tread-inspired sole thatג€™s made to handle roads and have extra traction.

For EU/UK/JP sizing, thereג€™s a conversion chart at the bottom of the Prio product description. The Prio runs a bit small. We recommend going up 1/2 size from your usual athletic shoe size. Also, the Prio is wider than conventional running shoes. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Prio, so use the measuring info if you can. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. If your foot is really narrow and smaller than a menג€™s 10, you may want to check out the ג€womenג€™sג€ Prio.

Put on your Prio and Live Life Feet First! a What do I do with those straps on the Prio? Iג€™ll admit, this is one of my favorite things about the Prio. The huarache-sandal inspired heel strap can be used to hold your heel and ankle in place. Pull the straps through the ankle holes in the sole, and then lock them in place with the laces. The instep straps can be used to secure your instep, which can free up your toes and forefoot to relax and function better. Use the laces to tighten or loosen them to your liking. a Is the Prio Waterproof? Itג€™s not. But the breathable mesh upper should help it dry quickly if you get them wet. a Whatג€™s different between the Prio, HFS, and Speed Force? The Prio is our best-selling ג€do almost anythingג€ shoe ג€” running, hiking, working out, you name it. The Speed Force is our lightest, ג€most barefootג€ shoe.

For EU/UK/JP sizing, thereג€™s a conversion chart at the bottom of the Prio product description. The Prio runs a bit small. We recommend going up 1/2 size from your usual athletic shoe size. Also, the Prio is wider than conventional running shoes. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Prio, so use the measuring info if you can. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. If your foot is really narrow and smaller than a menג€™s 10, you may want to check out the ג€womenג€™sג€ Prio.

Long description: Product Description ג€My go-to shoes for just about everything.ג€ ג€“ Andy P. The Prio is the most comfortable shoe for everything you do. Whether youג€™re out on a run, trying out a new trail, hitting the gym, or toeing a slackline, youג€™ll love the Prioג€™s combination of freedom and protection. ג€Just-Rightג€ Protection: The Prio uses the same 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber as our Z-Trek sandal, so you get great protection while still getting the ground feedback that your feet love. The optional 2mm insole lets you have more or less of a ג€barefoot feelג€ depending on your mood. Lightweight: A menג€™s 9 is only 7.6 ounces each ג€“ youג€™ll barely notice you have them on. Secure-feeling: Our Huarache sandal-inspired reflective heel and instep straps hold your foot securely ג€“ with or without socks ג€“ while keeping your toes free to move. Plus, the Prio is made from 100% vegan-friendly materials. Imagine youג€™ve just come home after a long day at work or on the trail.

Practically anything. The Prio is our first ג€performanceג€ shoe. Itג€™s great road running, light trail running, walking, hiking, working out, Crossfit, biking, slackliningג€¦ itג€™s obviously up to you. Once you get them on, Iג€™m sure youג€™ll do things we never thought of (and we want to see pictures of that!). Put on your Prio and Live Life Feet First! a What do I do with those straps on the Prio? Iג€™ll admit, this is one of my favorite things about the Prio. The huarache-sandal inspired heel strap can be used to hold your heel and ankle in place. Pull the straps through the ankle holes in the sole, and then lock them in place with the laces. The instep straps can be used to secure your instep, which can free up your toes and forefoot to relax and function better. Use the laces to tighten or loosen them to your liking. a Is the Prio Waterproof? Itג€™s not. But the breathable mesh upper should help it dry quickly if you get them wet. a Whatג€™s different between the Prio, HFS, and Speed Force? The Prio is our best-selling ג€do almost anythingג€ shoe ג€” running, hiking, working out, you name it. The Speed Force is our lightest, ג€most barefootג€ shoe. HFS is lighter than the Prio, more rugged than the Speed Force. The HFSג€™s sole has a new tire tread-inspired sole thatג€™s made to handle roads and have extra traction.

For EU/UK/JP sizing, thereג€™s a conversion chart at the bottom of the Prio product description. The Prio runs a bit small. We recommend going up 1/2 size from your usual athletic shoe size. Also, the Prio is wider than conventional running shoes. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Prio, so use the measuring info if you can. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. If your foot is really narrow and smaller than a menג€™s 10, you may want to check out the ג€womenג€™sג€ Prio.

Long description: Product Description NOTE ג€” The Lena is on clearance because weג€™re discontinuing this style and replaced it with the womenג€™s Hana. Click Here to see that product. Get the fun and freedom of our best-selling sandals with super-cute closed-toe style and casual canvas comfort For years, people have told us, ג€We LOVE our sandals, but what do we do when itג€™s cold out, or when I need something with closed-toes for work, or if I need a bit more protection?ג€ The Lena is the answer for women. The Lena, like our other casual canvas shoe, the Hana, is meant to be a casual shoe. We donג€™t suggest that you run an ultramarathon in the Lena, but we know when you have our high-performance FeelTrueֲ® sandal base under your foot, some of you will do more in the Lena than just hanging out. Check out these reviews from Lena wearers What youג€™ll love about the Lena Itג€™s what makes all our Xero Shoes special ג€” we believe in feet! Your feet are supposed to bend, flex, and feel the world. The Lena lets you do that. Natural FIT ג€” the wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for proper posture, balance, and agility. Natural FUNCTION ג€” the flexible Lena lets your feet bend, move, and flex the way that feet are supposed to. Plus, theyג€™re so light, you might forget you have them on. A womanג€™s size 7 is only 6 ounces each. Natural FEEL ג€” the Lena uses the 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole from our Z-Trek sandal. That means you get protection while still letting you feel the sensations that your feet want. If you need a bit of extra protection, just toss in the optional 2mm insole. Vegan-friendly materials ג€” the Lena has a canvas upper, with a cotton lining and microfiber accents. You can wash it with soap and water. Huarache-inspired design ג€” the heel/instep strap adds a subtle, eye-catching call out, but itג€™s also functional, holding your heel and cinching up around your instep. Flexible heel ג€” you can step on the heel and wear the Lena as a slide Is the Lena just for women? Weג€™ve designed it as a ג€womanג€™sג€ shoe. Compared to the Hana, the shape is a bit narrower and accommodates a slightly higher instep. The pattern offers a bit more adjustment, too. The canvas isnג€™t as ג€outdoorsyג€ as the one in the Hana. That said, men with a narrow foot might still like the Lena. And women with wider feet may want to try the Hana. a What can I do in the Lena? Though the Lena is designed as a casual shoe, itג€™s certainly capable of much more than just hanging out. Weג€™ve had people do all kinds of outrageous activities in them so far, but itג€™s up to your best judgment what you believe they are capable of handling. So, use your common sense and have fun! a How do I care for my Lenas? You can wash them with a mild soap and water mixture. The canvas is quite durable, and should come clean easily with a little scrubbing. DO NOT place your Lena in the dryer when you are finished cleaning, let them air dry. a Is the Lena only for Women? While we designed the Lena as a ג€womenג€™s shoeג€ ג€” slightly narrower than the Hana, slightly higher instep, slightly different pattern ג€” if youג€™re a man with a narrower foot, the Lena might be just right for you. a How do I find my size for the Lena? Shoe sizing, especially online, is not a perfect process. Thatג€™s why we have a free exchange policy. We have sizing instructions at the bottom of the product description for the Lena. The Lena fits ג€true-to-sizeג€ or a TINY bit small. So youג€™ll probably be okay selecting your ג€usualג€ shoe size. If you think youג€™re ג€between sizes,ג€ go up a 1/2 size. Also, the Lena is wider than conventional shoes. Some people have experienced stretching in the canvas upper to slightly wider. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Lena. If your foot is bigger than the Lena, check out the Hana instead. a Why do my Lenas suddenly feel looser? The canvas upper of the Lena can stretch a little bit. Most people find this more comfortable as it happens. You should be able to adjust the lacing to feel snug around your midfoot and let your toes be free. a Is the Lena Waterproof? No, the Lena is a canvas shoe, and will absorb any water it encounters. It is a light canvas, though, and should dry pretty fast after you take them off. Also, you can treat the Lena with an aftermarket waterproofing sprayג€¦ but that will make them a bit less flexible. Load More a Whatג€™s your return policy?

That means you get protection while still letting you feel the sensations that your feet want. If you need a bit of extra protection, just toss in the optional 2mm insole. Vegan-friendly materials ג€” the Lena has a canvas upper, with a cotton lining and microfiber accents. You can wash it with soap and water. Huarache-inspired design ג€” the heel/instep strap adds a subtle, eye-catching call out, but itג€™s also functional, holding your heel and cinching up around your instep. Flexible heel ג€” you can step on the heel and wear the Lena as a slide Is the Lena just for women? Weג€™ve designed it as a ג€womanג€™sג€ shoe. Compared to the Hana, the shape is a bit narrower and accommodates a slightly higher instep. The pattern offers a bit more adjustment, too. The canvas isnג€™t as ג€outdoorsyג€ as the one in the Hana. That said, men with a narrow foot might still like the Lena. And women with wider feet may want to try the Hana. a What can I do in the Lena? Though the Lena is designed as a casual shoe, itג€™s certainly capable of much more than just hanging out. Weג€™ve had people do all kinds of outrageous activities in them so far, but itג€™s up to your best judgment what you believe they are capable of handling. So, use your common sense and have fun! a How do I care for my Lenas? You can wash them with a mild soap and water mixture. The canvas is quite durable, and should come clean easily with a little scrubbing. DO NOT place your Lena in the dryer when you are finished cleaning, let them air dry. a Is the Lena only for Women? While we designed the Lena as a ג€womenג€™s shoeג€ ג€” slightly narrower than the Hana, slightly higher instep, slightly different pattern ג€” if youג€™re a man with a narrower foot, the Lena might be just right for you. a How do I find my size for the Lena? Shoe sizing, especially online, is not a perfect process. Thatג€™s why we have a free exchange policy. We have sizing instructions at the bottom of the product description for the Lena. The Lena fits ג€true-to-sizeג€ or a TINY bit small. So youג€™ll probably be okay selecting your ג€usualג€ shoe size. If you think youג€™re ג€between sizes,ג€ go up a 1/2 size. Also, the Lena is wider than conventional shoes. Some people have experienced stretching in the canvas upper to slightly wider. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Lena. If your foot is bigger than the Lena, check out the Hana instead. a Why do my Lenas suddenly feel looser? The canvas upper of the Lena can stretch a little bit. Most people find this more comfortable as it happens. You should be able to adjust the lacing to feel snug around your midfoot and let your toes be free. a Is the Lena Waterproof? No, the Lena is a canvas shoe, and will absorb any water it encounters. It is a light canvas, though, and should dry pretty fast after you take them off. Also, you can treat the Lena with an aftermarket waterproofing sprayג€¦ but that will make them a bit less flexible. Load More a Whatג€™s your return policy?

Long description: Product Description NOTE ג€” The Lena is on clearance because weג€™re discontinuing this style and replaced it with the womenג€™s Hana. Click Here to see that product. Get the fun and freedom of our best-selling sandals with super-cute closed-toe style and casual canvas comfort For years, people have told us, ג€We LOVE our sandals, but what do we do when itג€™s cold out, or when I need something with closed-toes for work, or if I need a bit more protection?ג€ The Lena is the answer for women. The Lena, like our other casual canvas shoe, the Hana, is meant to be a casual shoe. We donג€™t suggest that you run an ultramarathon in the Lena, but we know when you have our high-performance FeelTrueֲ® sandal base under your foot, some of you will do more in the Lena than just hanging out. Check out these reviews from Lena wearers What youג€™ll love about the Lena Itג€™s what makes all our Xero Shoes special ג€” we believe in feet! Your feet are supposed to bend, flex, and feel the world. The Lena lets you do that. Natural FIT ג€” the wide toe box lets your toes spread and relax. Plus the ג€XERO-dropג€ sole (non-elevated heel and low-to-the-ground) allows for proper posture, balance, and agility. Natural FUNCTION ג€” the flexible Lena lets your feet bend, move, and flex the way that feet are supposed to. Plus, theyג€™re so light, you might forget you have them on. A womanג€™s size 7 is only 6 ounces each. Natural FEEL ג€” the Lena uses the 5.5mm FeelTrueֲ® rubber sole from our Z-Trek sandal. That means you get protection while still letting you feel the sensations that your feet want. If you need a bit of extra protection, just toss in the optional 2mm insole. Vegan-friendly materials ג€” the Lena has a canvas upper, with a cotton lining and microfiber accents. You can wash it with soap and water. Huarache-inspired design ג€” the heel/instep strap adds a subtle, eye-catching call out, but itג€™s also functional, holding your heel and cinching up around your instep. Flexible heel ג€” you can step on the heel and wear the Lena as a slide Is the Lena just for women? Weג€™ve designed it as a ג€womanג€™sג€ shoe. Compared to the Hana, the shape is a bit narrower and accommodates a slightly higher instep. The pattern offers a bit more adjustment, too. The canvas isnג€™t as ג€outdoorsyג€ as the one in the Hana. That said, men with a narrow foot might still like the Lena. And women with wider feet may want to try the Hana. a What can I do in the Lena? Though the Lena is designed as a casual shoe, itג€™s certainly capable of much more than just hanging out. Weג€™ve had people do all kinds of outrageous activities in them so far, but itג€™s up to your best judgment what you believe they are capable of handling. So, use your common sense and have fun! a How do I care for my Lenas? You can wash them with a mild soap and water mixture. The canvas is quite durable, and should come clean easily with a little scrubbing. DO NOT place your Lena in the dryer when you are finished cleaning, let them air dry. a Is the Lena only for Women? While we designed the Lena as a ג€womenג€™s shoeג€ ג€” slightly narrower than the Hana, slightly higher instep, slightly different pattern ג€” if youג€™re a man with a narrower foot, the Lena might be just right for you. a How do I find my size for the Lena? Shoe sizing, especially online, is not a perfect process. Thatג€™s why we have a free exchange policy. We have sizing instructions at the bottom of the product description for the Lena. The Lena fits ג€true-to-sizeג€ or a TINY bit small. So youג€™ll probably be okay selecting your ג€usualג€ shoe size. If you think youג€™re ג€between sizes,ג€ go up a 1/2 size. Also, the Lena is wider than conventional shoes. Some people have experienced stretching in the canvas upper to slightly wider. Keep in mind, though, that because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock deviceֲ®, can only approximate your true shoe size. Manufacturers model their shoes on different foot shapes, which is why you might be an 8 in one brand and a 9 in another. Sizing for a shoe is different than a sandal, so if you own one of our sandals, that doesnג€™t mean youג€™ll pick the same size in the Lena. If your foot is bigger than the Lena, check out the Hana instead. a Why do my Lenas suddenly feel looser? The canvas upper of the Lena can stretch a little bit. Most people find this more comfortable as it happens. You should be able to adjust the lacing to feel snug around your midfoot and let your toes be free. a Is the Lena Waterproof? No, the Lena is a canvas shoe, and will absorb any water it encounters. It is a light canvas, though, and should dry pretty fast after you take them off. Also, you can treat the Lena with an aftermarket waterproofing sprayג€¦ but that will make them a bit less flexible. Load More a Whatג€™s your return policy? Please go to Xero Shoes Return Policy page to learn about our 45-day return policy. a Do you ship internationally? We do! Weג€™ve sold Xero Shoes to people in more than 85 countries around the world.

Arthur Fellig’s ability to arrive at a crime scene just as the cops did was so uncanny that he renamed himself “Weegee,” claiming that he functioned as a human Ouija board. Weegee documented better than any other photographer the crime, grit, and complex humanity of midcentury New York City. In Flash, we get a portrait not only of the man (both flawed and deeply talented, with generous appetites for publicity, women, and hot pastrami) but also of the fascinating time and place that he occupied. From self-taught immigrant kid to newshound to art-world darling to latter-day caricature―moving from the dangerous streets of New York City to the celebrity culture of Los Angeles and then to Europe for a quixotic late phase of experimental photography and filmmaking―Weegee lived a life just as worthy of documentation as the scenes he captured. With Flash, we have an unprecedented and ultimately moving view of the man now regarded as an innovator and a pioneer, an artist as well as a newsman, whose photographs are among most powerful images of urban existence ever made.","label":"None_of_the_above"},{"text":"Best friends don’t always make the best travel companions. At home, it might sound like a good idea to spend two weeks road tripping with your bestie around the West Coast or exploring Europe by rail. But on vacation, you learn a lot about a person. For example, it can be awfully frustrating to find your best pal snoring when you’re ready to be out there exploring, and just imagine how they feel when you tell them you want to jump out of a plane and all they want to do is jump into the hotel pool. In fact, nearly half (50%) of millennial travelers have had a bad travel companion. Almost 40% of other travelers have, too and 48% say that personality differences have ruined a trip. The way each of us travels isn’t wrong of course, but knowing up front whether or not you’re travel compatible can save a lot of heartache. Based on survey data, we created the following quiz to help you find your vacation soulmate.","label":"None_of_the_above"},{"text":"While some people like to do as little as possible while on vacation, others are more interested in getting their heart pumping and exploring the great outdoors.
